portfolio_service.update_mark_prices(adapter.get_current_marks())

# Fee integration  
fee_calc = await fees_engine.calculate_order_fee(symbol, notional, is_post_only)
if fee_calc.fee_amount > max_acceptable_fee:
    # Adjust order or use maker strategy

# Margin checks
margin_snapshot = await margin_monitor.compute_margin_state(equity, cash, positions)
if margin_snapshot.margin_utilization > 0.8:
    # Reduce position sizes or deny new entries

# Order validation
allowed, reason = policy_matrix.validate_order(symbol, order_type, tif, quantity)
if not allowed:
    # Reject order with explanation
```
