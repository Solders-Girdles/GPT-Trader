# Paper Trade Dashboard Refactor – Phase 1 Complete

**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Pattern:** Extract → Test → Integrate → Validate

## What Changed

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Formatter helpers | `PaperTradingDashboard.format_currency`, `format_pct` inline | `dashboard/formatters.py` with `CurrencyFormatter`, `PercentageFormatter`, `DashboardFormatter` |
| File structure | Single module at `dashboard.py` | Package structure `dashboard/` with `__init__.py`, `main.py`, `formatters.py` |
| Tests | 45 existing | +6 formatter tests (51 total suite for dashboard) |

### Highlights
- Created `DashboardFormatter` (currency & percentage helpers) with dedicated unit tests.
- Converted `paper_trade/dashboard.py` into package; original dashboard class moved to `dashboard/main.py` to maintain imports.
- `PaperTradingDashboard` now holds a formatter instance and exposes wrapper methods for backwards compatibility.
- Added `tests/unit/bot_v2/features/paper_trade/dashboard/test_formatters.py` covering positive/negative/zero formatting cases.

## Metrics

- `dashboard/main.py`: 401 → 399 lines (-2) – minimal reduction in this phase; groundwork laid for deeper extractions.
- `formatters.py`: 40 focused lines.
- Dashboard suite: 45 → 51 tests; full suite (`pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/features/paper_trade`) still green (370 tests).

## Notes & Compat

- Existing tests referencing `format_currency` / `format_pct` continue to pass (wrappers preserved).
- Package `__init__.py` re-exports `PaperTradingDashboard` so import paths remain `from bot_v2.features.paper_trade.dashboard import PaperTradingDashboard`.
- Future phases can reuse the formatter module wherever needed (HTML writer, console renderer, etc.).

## Next Steps

Phase 2 will extract the metrics calculation into `dashboard/metrics.py`, shrinking `main.py` more substantially and adding targeted tests for returns/drawdown/win-rate calculations.
