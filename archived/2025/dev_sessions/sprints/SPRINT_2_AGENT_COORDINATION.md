## 🎯 Agent Success Metrics

| Agent | Success Criteria | Measurement |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| `ml-strategy-director` | Pipeline latency <100ms | Performance test |
| `backtest-engineer` | 95% statistical confidence | A/B test validation |

## 🚨 Escalation Path

If blocking issues arise:

1. **Technical Issues** → `ml-strategy-director` → `tech-lead-orchestrator`
2. **Performance Issues** → `debugger` → `performance-optimizer`
3. **Risk/Compliance** → `risk-analyst` → `compliance-officer`
4. **Infrastructure** → `devops-lead` → `deployment-engineer`

## ✅ Daily Checkpoints

Each day at 5 PM:
- Agent status reports
- Blocking issues identified
- Next day preparation
- Progress against metrics
