- Task cleanup and cancellation
- Concurrent task execution

✅ **Configuration Management** (6 tests)
- Context updates and component preservation
- Engine selection based on risk configuration
- Config controller integration
- Missing dependency handling

✅ **Error Resilience** (6 tests)
- Graceful error handling in decision execution
- Missing component handling
- Engine availability checks
- Health status reporting

✅ **Integration Testing** (8 tests)
- End-to-end workflows
- Component interactions
- Runtime state management
- Cross-component communication

✅ **Production Semantics** (6 tests)
- Log-and-continue behavior validation
- Context immutability compliance
- API compatibility fixes
- Error handling pattern alignment

## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### API Compatibility Fixes
- ✅ Product constructor parameter corrections (`base_asset` vs `base_currency`)
- ✅ Order constructor parameter fixes (`type` vs `order_type`)
- ✅ Execution engine method name corrections (`place_order` vs `place`)
- ✅ Context immutability handling with `with_updates()` method

### Test Quality Improvements
- ✅ Production semantics alignment - tests match actual behavior
- ✅ Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- ✅ Proper async testing patterns with task cancellation
- ✅ Resource cleanup and memory leak prevention

### Architecture Patterns Established
- ✅ Async Loop Control Pattern for background tasks
- ✅ Log-and-Continue Assertion Pattern for error handling
- ✅ Context Immutability Pattern for configuration changes
- ✅ Diff Builder Pattern for reconciliation testing
- ✅ Component Integration Pattern for end-to-end workflows

## 📋 Next Steps Identified

### Immediate Quick Wins (Option 2)
- **runtime_settings.py**: 70.50% → target 80%+
- **symbols.py**: 48.96% → target 80%+
- **live_execution.py**: 40.66% → target 60%+

### Expected Impact
