# Legacy test triage manifest.
#
# Keys are repo-relative file paths (use forward slashes).
# Values track whether a test file should be deleted or modernized.
#
# Example:
# tests/integration/test_some_old_thing.py:
#   action: delete  # or: modernize
#   status: todo    # optional: todo|in_progress|done
#   reason: "Why this is legacy or redundant"
#   owner: "name/handle"  # optional
#   added: "2026-01-18"   # optional (YYYY-MM-DD)
tests:
  tests/integration/test_simple_start.py:
    action: delete
    status: todo
    reason: "Legacy bot startup test uses global container + heavy patching; redundant with newer TradingBot unit/integration coverage."
    added: "2026-01-19"
