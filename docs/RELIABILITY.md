This document describes the reliability layer that protects GPT-Trader during
startup and live trading. It covers the decision matrix, configuration defaults,
the chaos harness for fault injection, and a rollout checklist.

## Scope

Reliability is delivered by four packages that work together:

- API Health Guard: runtime checks of error rate, rate limits, and circuit breakers.
- Preflight Diagnostics: startup checks for API connectivity, accounts, and market data.
- Graceful Degradation: pause and reduce-only responses when safety checks trip.
- Chaos Harness: fault injection utilities for testing degradation behavior.

Implementation references:

- `src/gpt_trader/features/live_trade/execution/guards/api_health.py`
- `src/gpt_trader/preflight/checks/diagnostics.py`
- `src/gpt_trader/features/live_trade/degradation.py` (canonical location)
- `tests/support/chaos.py`

## Decision Matrix

| Trigger | Signal | Response | Config |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preflight diagnostics fail | `scripts/production_preflight.py` errors on API, accounts, or market data | Exit non-zero; block startup unless warn-only | `--warn-only` or `GPT_TRADER_PREFLIGHT_WARN_ONLY=1` |
| API health trip | ApiHealthGuard sees open circuit or thresholds | Cancel open orders, reduce-only, global pause | `RISK_API_HEALTH_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` |
| Mark staleness | `check_mark_staleness` true | Pause symbol; allow reduce-only if configured | `RISK_MARK_STALENESS_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`, `RISK_MARK_STALENESS_ALLOW_REDUCE_ONLY` |
| Slippage failures | Repeated slippage guard ValidationError | Pause symbol after threshold | `RISK_SLIPPAGE_FAILURE_PAUSE_AFTER`, `RISK_SLIPPAGE_PAUSE_SECONDS` |
| Validation infra failure | ValidationFailureTracker escalation | Reduce-only + global pause | `RISK_VALIDATION_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` |
| Preview failures | Preview exceptions reach threshold | Disable preview for the session | `RISK_PREVIEW_FAILURE_DISABLE_AFTER` |
| Broker read failures | Consecutive balance/position read failures | Global pause (reduce-only allowed) | `RISK_BROKER_OUTAGE_MAX_FAILURES`, `RISK_BROKER_OUTAGE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` |
| Order reconciliation drift | Broker open orders include bot-owned IDs missing from open_orders/orders_store | Reduce-only + global pause after 3 consecutive detections; attempt cancels; alert operator | `ORDER_RECONCILIATION_DRIFT_MAX_FAILURES` (constant), `RISK_API_HEALTH_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` |
| WS max reconnect | WebSocket exceeds max reconnection attempts | Global pause + callback for degradation | `GPT_TRADER_WS_RECONNECT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `GPT_TRADER_WS_RECONNECT_PAUSE_SECONDS` |

Notes:

- Global and symbol pauses allow reduce-only orders by default.
- Reduce-only blocks new positions but allows position-closing orders.

## Config Knobs and Defaults

API Health Guard:

| Env Var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RISK_API_ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD` | `0.2` | Error rate threshold to trip the guard |
| `RISK_API_RATE_LIMIT_USAGE_THRESHOLD` | `0.9` | Rate limit usage threshold to trip the guard |

Graceful Degradation:

| Env Var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RISK_API_HEALTH_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `300` | Global pause duration after API health trip |
| `RISK_MARK_STALENESS_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `120` | Per-symbol pause when mark data is stale |
| `RISK_MARK_STALENESS_ALLOW_REDUCE_ONLY` | `1` | Allow reduce-only during mark staleness |
| `RISK_SLIPPAGE_FAILURE_PAUSE_AFTER` | `3` | Failures before symbol pause |
| `RISK_SLIPPAGE_PAUSE_SECONDS` | `60` | Per-symbol pause duration for slippage |
| `RISK_VALIDATION_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `180` | Global pause after validation infra failure |
| `RISK_PREVIEW_FAILURE_DISABLE_AFTER` | `5` | Failures before preview auto-disable |
| `RISK_BROKER_OUTAGE_MAX_FAILURES` | `3` | Failures before global pause |
| `RISK_BROKER_OUTAGE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `120` | Global pause duration for broker outage |

WebSocket Reconnection:

| Env Var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GPT_TRADER_WS_RECONNECT_BACKOFF_BASE` | `2.0` | Base delay in seconds for exponential backoff |
| `GPT_TRADER_WS_RECONNECT_BACKOFF_MAX` | `60.0` | Maximum delay cap (prevents unbounded growth) |
| `GPT_TRADER_WS_RECONNECT_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER` | `2.0` | Exponential growth multiplier |
| `GPT_TRADER_WS_RECONNECT_JITTER_PCT` | `0.25` | Jitter ±25% to prevent thundering herd |

| `GPT_TRADER_WS_RECONNECT_PAUSE_SECONDS` | `300` | Global pause duration when max attempts exceeded |

The reconnection algorithm uses exponential backoff with jitter:
- Delay = `base * (multiplier ^ attempt)`, capped at `max`
- Jitter randomizes ±`jitter_pct` to prevent synchronized reconnection storms
- Attempt counter resets after connection is stable for `reset_seconds`
- When max attempts exceeded, triggers `on_max_attempts_exceeded` callback for degradation

## Observability

Canonical reference for metrics, traces, structured logs, and alert query patterns:

- `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`
- `docs/MONITORING_PLAYBOOK.md` (setup + incident workflows)

## Profiling & Memory

Lightweight profiling hooks for timing critical code paths and tracking memory usage.

### Profile Spans

Use `profile_span` context manager to time code blocks and emit to Prometheus histograms:

```python
from gpt_trader.monitoring.profiling import profile_span

with profile_span("fetch_positions") as sample:
    positions = await broker.list_positions()
# sample.duration_ms contains timing
```

All profile spans are recorded to the `gpt_trader_profile_duration_seconds` histogram with a `phase` label.

### Instrumented Hot Paths

| Phase | Location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fetch_positions` | `_cycle_inner()` | Broker position fetch |
| `equity_computation` | `_cycle_inner()` | Balance fetch and equity calculation |
| `strategy_decision` | `_cycle_inner()` | Strategy decision logic |
| `order_placement` | `_cycle_inner()` | Order validation and submission |
| `pre_trade_validation` | `_validate_and_place_order()` | Full guard stack validation |

### Latency Histograms

Dedicated histograms for key operations:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt_trader_positions_fetch_seconds` | histogram | `result=ok\|error` | Time to fetch positions |
| `gpt_trader_equity_computation_seconds` | histogram | `result=ok\|error` | Time to calculate equity |
| `gpt_trader_profile_duration_seconds` | histogram | `phase` | General profiling spans |

### Memory Gauges

| Metric | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt_trader_process_memory_mb` | gauge | Process RSS memory in MB |
| `gpt_trader_event_store_cache_size` | gauge | Events in memory cache |
| `gpt_trader_deque_cache_fill_ratio` | gauge | Cache fill ratio (0.0-1.0) |

Memory metrics are collected by `SystemMaintenanceService.report_system_status()` each trading cycle.

### Usage

```python
from gpt_trader.monitoring.profiling import profile_span, record_profile, ProfileSample

# Context manager (recommended)
with profile_span("custom_operation", {"key": "value"}):
    do_work()

# Manual timing
start = time.perf_counter()
do_work()
duration_ms = (time.perf_counter() - start) * 1000
record_profile("custom_operation", duration_ms)
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Batched Market Data Fetches

The trading engine uses `get_tickers()` to fetch ticker data for multiple symbols efficiently:

- **Advanced API mode**: Single `get_best_bid_ask()` call for all symbols, returns mid-price
- **Exchange API mode**: Falls back to sequential `get_ticker()` calls per symbol

The batch method is called once before the per-symbol loop, reducing API calls from N to 1 in Advanced mode. If a symbol is missing from the batch result (e.g., partial failure), it falls back to an individual `get_ticker()` call.

Implementation: `ProductService.get_tickers()` in `src/gpt_trader/features/brokerages/coinbase/rest/product_service.py`

### Concurrent Broker Calls

The strategy engine parallelizes independent broker operations:

- `_fetch_positions()` and `_audit_orders()` run concurrently via `asyncio.create_task()`
- Per-symbol ticker and candles fetches are bounded by `asyncio.Semaphore` (default 5 concurrent calls)
- Configurable via `config.max_concurrent_rest_calls` (defaults to 5)
- Optional dedicated executor via `config.broker_calls_use_dedicated_executor` (defaults to `False`)
- Order submission retries are optional via `config.order_submission_retries_enabled` / `ORDER_SUBMISSION_RETRIES_ENABLED` (defaults to `False`)

This reduces cycle latency by overlapping I/O-bound operations while preventing API rate limit exhaustion.

## Chaos Harness (Fault Injection)

The chaos harness is intended for deterministic tests that validate the
degradation responses without flaky network dependencies.

Key types and helpers (from `tests/support/chaos.py`):

- `FaultAction`: describes a fault (after_calls, times, raise_exc, return_value).
- `FaultPlan`: manages ordered faults with per-method call tracking.
- `ChaosBroker`: proxy that applies FaultPlan to a wrapped broker.
- Helpers: `fault_once`, `fault_after`, `fault_always`, `fault_sequence`.

Example: inject a broker outage after two balance reads.

```python
from tests.support.chaos import ChaosBroker, FaultPlan, fault_after
from gpt_trader.features.brokerages.mock import DeterministicBroker

plan = FaultPlan().add(
    "list_balances",
    fault_after(2, raise_exc=TimeoutError("broker read timeout")),
)
broker = ChaosBroker(DeterministicBroker(), plan)
```

Example: use a scenario preset.

```python
from tests.support.chaos import ChaosBroker, api_outage_scenario
from gpt_trader.features.brokerages.mock import DeterministicBroker

broker = ChaosBroker(DeterministicBroker(), api_outage_scenario())
```

Tip: avoid real delays in tests by passing a no-op `sleep_func` to `ChaosBroker` (for example,
`sleep_func=lambda _: None`). Prefer injected sleep over patching `time.sleep`.

## Rollout Checklist

1. Run preflight in canary and prod:
   - `uv run python scripts/production_preflight.py --profile canary`
   - `uv run python scripts/production_preflight.py --profile prod`
2. Confirm reliability defaults in `.env` or exported overrides for RISK_* vars.
3. Run chaos tests:
   - `pytest tests/unit/support/test_chaos.py`
   - `pytest tests/unit/gpt_trader/features/live_trade/engines/test_strategy_engine_chaos.py`
4. Canary deploy with reduce-only for 24h; monitor guard and pause logs.
5. Promote to prod; keep preflight reports and guard events archived.
6. Only use `--warn-only` during incident response and document the reason.
