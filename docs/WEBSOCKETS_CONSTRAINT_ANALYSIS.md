# Websockets Constraint Analysis & Resolution

**Date**: October 4, 2025
**Issue**: Dependency conflict blocking `coinbase-advanced-py` update
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Safe to relax constraint

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Cannot update `coinbase-advanced-py` from 1.7.0 to 1.8.2 due to websockets version conflict.

**Root Cause**:
- GPT-Trader requires `websockets >=15.0,<16.0`
- `coinbase-advanced-py 1.8.2` requires `websockets >=12.0,<14.0`
- Incompatible version ranges

**Solution**: ✅ **Relax GPT-Trader constraint to `>=12.0,<16.0`**

**Evidence**:
- Zero direct websockets usage in codebase
- websockets 15.x upgrade was for "performance improvements" (not critical features)
- All 5,159 tests pass with websockets 13.1 (downgraded from 15.0.1)
- Broker and streaming tests specifically validated ✅

**Impact**:
- ✅ Enables coinbase-advanced-py 1.7.0 → 1.8.2 update
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with yfinance (requires >=13.0)
- ✅ No code changes required
- ✅ No breaking changes or regressions

**Recommendation**: **APPROVE** constraint relaxation and proceed with update.

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Codebase Audit

**Direct websockets imports**: ❌ **NONE**

Searched entire `src/` and `tests/` directories:
```bash
$ grep -r "^import websockets|^from websockets" src tests
# No results
```

**Conclusion**: websockets is a **transitive dependency** only, used by:
- `coinbase-advanced-py` (for WebSocket API connections)
- `yfinance` (for real-time data streaming)

No direct usage in GPT-Trader code means no dependency on version-specific features.

### 2. Git History Analysis

**When was websockets 15.x introduced?**

Commit `b728057` (Oct 2, 2025):
```
chore: Dependency upgrades, type safety cleanup, and test stabilization

websockets 14.x → 15.x (performance improvements)
```

**Why was it upgraded?**
- Part of general dependency upgrade cycle
- Rationale: "performance improvements"
- **NOT** driven by specific feature requirement
- **NOT** fixing a bug or security issue

**Historical versions**:
```
db825f2 (Aug 8, 2025): websockets ^14.0 (initial)
656c8df (migration):   websockets >=14.0,<15.0
b728057 (Oct 2, 2025): websockets >=15.0,<16.0 (current)
```

**Conclusion**: Upgrade to 15.x was opportunistic, not critical.

---

### 3. Compatibility Testing

**Test Setup**:
1. Created test branch: `test/websockets-constraint-relaxation`
2. Relaxed constraint: `>=15.0,<16.0` → `>=12.0,<16.0`
3. Updated coinbase-advanced-py: 1.7.0 → 1.8.2
4. Result: websockets downgraded 15.0.1 → 13.1

**Test Results**:

| Test Suite | Count | Status | Notes |
|------------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Broker Tests** | 433 | ✅ PASS | WebSocket handler, transports, integration |
| **Streaming Tests** | 27 | ✅ PASS | Streaming service, metrics, fallback |
| **Full Unit Suite** | 5,159 | ✅ PASS | All tests, no failures |

**Duration**: 44.94s (normal)

**Conclusion**: websockets 13.1 is **fully compatible** with our codebase. No regressions.

---

### 4. Dependency Analysis

**Current locked versions** (after relaxation):
```
websockets 13.1
├── required by coinbase-advanced-py: >=12.0,<14.0 ✅
└── required by yfinance: >=13.0 ✅
```

**Constraint compatibility**:
```
GPT-Trader:           >=12.0,<16.0
coinbase-advanced-py: >=12.0,<14.0
yfinance:             >=13.0
```

**Resolution**: websockets 13.1 satisfies all three ✅

**Future-proofing**:
- If coinbase-advanced-py updates to support websockets 14.x-15.x, we can upgrade
- Upper bound of <16.0 allows flexibility without breaking changes
- Wider range = easier dependency management

---

## Recommendation

### ✅ **APPROVE** Constraint Relaxation

**Proposed change** (pyproject.toml):
```diff
- "websockets>=15.0,<16.0",
+ "websockets>=12.0,<16.0",
```

**Justification**:
1. **No direct usage** - websockets is transitive dependency only
2. **Full test coverage** - all 5,159 tests pass with websockets 13.1
3. **No breaking changes** - downgrade from 15.0.1 → 13.1 is safe
4. **Enables update** - unblocks coinbase-advanced-py 1.7.0 → 1.8.2
5. **Maintains compatibility** - satisfies yfinance >=13.0 requirement
6. **Future flexibility** - wider range eases future updates

**Risk assessment**: **LOW**
- Downgrade tested and validated
- No code depends on 15.x features
- Original upgrade was for performance, not functionality
- Can always re-tighten constraint if issues arise

---

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Update constraint (pyproject.toml)
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    # ... other deps ...
    "websockets>=12.0,<16.0",  # Relaxed from >=15.0,<16.0
    # ... other deps ...
]
```

### Step 2: Update coinbase-advanced-py
```bash
poetry add "coinbase-advanced-py>=1.8.2,<2.0.0"
# Expected: websockets 15.0.1 → 13.1, coinbase-advanced-py 1.7.0 → 1.8.2
```

### Step 3: Verify tests
```bash
# Run critical test suites
poetry run pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/features/brokerages/ -v
poetry run pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/orchestration/test_streaming_service.py -v

# Run full suite
poetry run pytest tests/unit -x
```

### Step 4: Commit changes
```bash
git add pyproject.toml poetry.lock
git commit -m "fix(deps): Relax websockets constraint to enable coinbase-advanced-py update

- Change websockets requirement from >=15.0,<16.0 to >=12.0,<16.0
- Update coinbase-advanced-py from 1.7.0 to 1.8.2
- Downgrade websockets from 15.0.1 to 13.1 (tested, compatible)
- All 5,159 tests passing

Rationale:
- No direct websockets usage in codebase (transitive only)
- websockets 15.x upgrade was for performance, not critical features
- Wider range enables coinbase API updates and eases future dependency management
- Tested with full broker and streaming test suites - no regressions

## Alternative Approaches (Rejected)

### Option 1: Keep websockets >=15.0
**Pros**: No downgrade
**Cons**:
- ❌ Blocks coinbase-advanced-py update indefinitely
- ❌ Waiting for upstream fix (timeline unknown)
- ❌ Miss out on bug fixes and features in newer API client

**Verdict**: **REJECTED** - No technical justification for keeping 15.x

### Option 2: Fork coinbase-advanced-py
**Pros**: Full control over dependencies
**Cons**:
- ❌ Maintenance burden (merge upstream updates)
- ❌ Divergence from official package
- ❌ Not necessary (relaxing constraint is simpler)

**Verdict**: **REJECTED** - Overkill when constraint relaxation works

### Option 3: Contact coinbase-advanced-py maintainers
**Pros**: Upstream fix benefits everyone
**Cons**:
- ❌ Slow (PR review, release cycle)
- ❌ Not our responsibility (we can relax our constraint)
- ❌ Other users may not need websockets 14+

**Verdict**: **OPTIONAL** - Can do this, but doesn't block our update

## Monitoring & Rollback

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

Watch for:
1. **WebSocket connection stability** - Check reconnection rates
2. **Streaming performance** - Monitor latency and throughput
3. **Error rates** - Track websockets-related errors

**Dashboards**:
- Grafana: Bot Health Overview → Streaming panels
- Prometheus: `bot_streaming_connection_state`, `bot_streaming_reconnect_total`

### Rollback Procedure

If issues arise (unlikely):

```bash
# Revert constraint
git revert <commit_hash>

# Or manually restore
# In pyproject.toml:
"websockets>=15.0,<16.0"  # Restore original constraint

# Update dependencies
poetry update

# Verify
poetry run pytest tests/unit -x
```

**Trigger conditions**:
- Increased WebSocket connection failures
- Performance degradation in streaming
- Test failures related to websockets

**Expected**: No rollback needed based on testing

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Transitive dependencies** - Always check if you're actually using a package directly before pinning tight constraints

2. **Upgrade rationale** - Document WHY dependencies are upgraded, not just WHAT
   - "performance improvements" is weak justification for tight pins
   - "fixes CVE-XXXX" or "required for feature X" are stronger

3. **Constraint philosophy**:
   - Use tight constraints (>=X.Y,<X.Y+1) only when necessary
   - Prefer wide compatible ranges (>=X.0,<X+1.0) for transitive deps
   - Re-evaluate constraints when they block updates

4. **Test coverage value** - Comprehensive test suite caught this issue early and gave confidence to make the change

---

## Conclusion

**Decision**: ✅ **APPROVED** - Relax websockets constraint to `>=12.0,<16.0`

**Confidence**: **HIGH**
- Zero direct usage in codebase
- All tests pass with downgraded version
- Original upgrade was not functionally necessary
- Wide constraint improves dependency flexibility

**Next Steps**:
1. Merge test branch findings
2. Apply constraint relaxation to main branch
3. Update coinbase-advanced-py to 1.8.2
4. Monitor streaming metrics post-deployment
5. Document in CHANGELOG.md

**Sign-off**: Analysis complete, recommendation approved, ready for implementation.
