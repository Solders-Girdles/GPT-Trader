# üìã Deprecation Audit Report
*Generated: 2025-08-12*

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive audit reveals **204 files** with potential deprecated content. Key issues include incomplete pickle migration, development phase markers in production code, and suppressed deprecation warnings.

## üö® Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Security: Incomplete Pickle Migration
**Risk Level: HIGH**
- **Files still referencing pickle:**
  - `src/bot/strategy/training_pipeline.py` - Comments mention "pickle for internal use"
  - `benchmarks/serialization_benchmark.py` - Active pickle benchmarking
  - Migration scripts still present (`scripts/pickle_*.py`)

**Action:** Complete migration to joblib, remove all pickle references

### 2. Active TODOs in Production Code
**Risk Level: MEDIUM**
- `src/bot/live/strategy_selector.py:359` - TODO: Integrate with LiveDataManager
- `src/bot/cli/strategy_development.py:343` - TODO: Implement your strategy logic
- `src/bot/strategy/persistence.py:686-687` - TODO: Calculate strategy_hash

**Action:** Address or create tickets for these TODOs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority Issues

### 3. Version Confusion (V1/V2 Pattern)
**Files with version markers:**
- `src/bot/live/trading_engine_v2.py` - Implies V1 exists
- `src/bot/monitor/live_risk_monitor_v2.py` - Duplicate monitoring systems?
- API endpoints using `/api/v1/` prefix

**Action:** Standardize versioning strategy, remove old versions

### 4. Development Sprint Markers
**Extensive phase/week references throughout:**
- 15+ PHASE completion files (now archived)
- Week 1-4 import sections in strategy files
- Phase 1-5 comments in production code

**Action:** Remove development markers from production code

### 5. Test Files for Deleted Features
**Orphaned test artifacts:**
- `test_demo_ma.py` references (deleted but cache remains)
- Week/Phase integration tests may test deprecated patterns
- Empty test directories indicating incomplete restructuring

**Action:** Clean test suite, remove obsolete tests

## üìä Code Quality Issues

### 6. Suppressed Deprecation Warnings
**Configuration:** `pytest.ini`
```ini
filterwarnings = ignore::DeprecationWarning
```
**Impact:** Hiding potential issues from developers

**Action:** Enable deprecation warnings, address issues properly

### 7. Excluded Test Linting
**Configuration:** `pyproject.toml`
```toml
extend-exclude = ["data", "tests", "scripts"]
```
**Impact:** Tests not subject to code quality checks

**Action:** Include tests in linting, fix any issues

## üì¶ Dependencies Analysis

### 8. Potentially Unused Dependencies
**Suspicious packages:**
- `click-completion` - Typer handles CLI, may be redundant
- `responses` - Mock library, check if actively used
- `freezegun` - Time mocking, verify usage

**Action:** Audit dependency usage with `pip-audit` or similar

### 9. Heavy Dependencies
**Large packages that may be underutilized:**
- `ray` - Distributed computing (2.48.0)
- `numba` - JIT compilation (0.61.2)
- `plotly` - Interactive plotting (6.2.0)

**Action:** Verify these are actively used or remove

## üìÅ File Organization Issues

### 10. Redundant Documentation
**Multiple overlapping docs:**
- Phase documentation duplicated across directories
- Weekly reports mixed with phase summaries
- Multiple "COMPLETE" and "SUMMARY" files

**Action:** Consolidate to single source of truth

## üîß Recommended Cleanup Actions

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. [ ] Complete pickle to joblib migration
2. [ ] Address 3 active TODOs
3. [ ] Enable deprecation warnings
4. [ ] Remove `test_demo_ma` cache files

### Short-term (Week 2-3)
5. [ ] Remove phase/week development markers
6. [ ] Consolidate V1/V2 versions
7. [ ] Clean up empty test directories
8. [ ] Include tests in linting scope

### Long-term (Month 1)
9. [ ] Audit and remove unused dependencies
10. [ ] Consolidate documentation
11. [ ] Remove migration scripts after verification
12. [ ] Create deprecation policy document

## üìà Metrics

### Current State
- **Files with deprecated markers:** 204
- **Active TODOs:** 3
- **Suppressed warnings:** All deprecation warnings
- **Orphaned test files:** ~15
- **Redundant docs:** 20+

### Target State
- **Files with deprecated markers:** < 50
- **Active TODOs:** 0 (or ticketed)
- **Suppressed warnings:** None
- **Orphaned test files:** 0
- **Redundant docs:** 0

## üõ†Ô∏è Automation Recommendations

### Pre-commit Hooks
```yaml
- id: check-todos
  name: Check for TODOs
  entry: grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX"
  language: system
  files: \.py$
```

### CI/CD Checks
- Deprecation warning detection
- Unused dependency scanning
- Dead code detection with `vulture`

## üìö Files for Immediate Removal

### Confirmed Safe to Delete
1. `scripts/pickle_scanner.py` - After migration complete
2. `scripts/pickle_to_joblib.py` - After migration complete
3. `benchmarks/serialization_benchmark.py` - If pickle benchmarks not needed
4. All `__pycache__` files for `test_demo_ma.py`

### Review Before Deletion
1. Phase/week integration test files
2. V1 versions of components (if V2 is stable)
3. Archived documentation older than 3 months

## üéØ Success Criteria

Deprecation cleanup is complete when:
- [ ] No pickle usage in production code
- [ ] No active TODOs in committed code
- [ ] All deprecation warnings addressed
- [ ] Tests included in linting
- [ ] No orphaned test files
- [ ] Clear versioning strategy
- [ ] No development markers in production

## üìù Notes

- Many deprecated patterns already addressed (good progress!)
- Pickle migration partially complete but needs finishing
- Test organization recently improved but needs cleanup
- Documentation consolidation in progress

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this report with team
2. Prioritize critical security issues
3. Create tickets for tracked work
4. Establish deprecation policy going forward
