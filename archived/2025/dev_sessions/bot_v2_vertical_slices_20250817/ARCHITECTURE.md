# GPT-Trader V2 Architecture

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

**Build for the future, avoid past mistakes.**

We've designed a component-based architecture that allows us to build each piece independently while guaranteeing they'll work together seamlessly. This solves the core problems that plagued the old system.

## 🔧 Core Components

### 1. **Interfaces** (`core/interfaces.py`)
Clean contracts that every component must implement:

```python
IDataProvider     → Provides market data
IStrategy         → Generates trading signals
IRiskManager      → Validates positions and orders
IPortfolioAllocator → Decides position sizes
IExecutor         → Executes trades
IAnalytics        → Tracks performance
IBacktester       → Runs simulations
```

### 2. **Event System** (`core/events.py`)
Publish-subscribe mechanism for loose coupling:

```python
EventBus → Central message broker
EventType → Standardized event types
Event → Base event with metadata

# Components communicate without direct dependencies
DataProvider → publishes → DATA_RECEIVED
Strategy → subscribes → DATA_RECEIVED → publishes → SIGNAL_GENERATED
RiskManager → subscribes → SIGNAL_GENERATED → publishes → ORDER_APPROVED
Executor → subscribes → ORDER_APPROVED → publishes → TRADE_EXECUTED
```

### 3. **Component Registry** (`core/registry.py`)
Dependency injection and lifecycle management:

```python
ComponentRegistry → Manages all components
- register_component() → Add components
- get_component() → Retrieve with type safety
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Lifecycle management (init/shutdown)
```

### 4. **Data Types** (`core/types.py`)
Standardized data structures that flow between components:

```python
MarketData → OHLCV + bid/ask
Signal → Strategy output with strength
Position → Open position tracking
Order → Order details and status
Trade → Executed trade record
Portfolio → Complete portfolio state
RiskMetrics → Risk measurements
PerformanceMetrics → Performance stats
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

### **1. Loose Coupling**
Components don't know about each other's implementation:
```python
# Strategy doesn't know about risk manager
strategy.analyze(data) → Signal
# Risk manager doesn't know about strategy
risk_manager.validate(signal) → Approved/Rejected
```

### **2. Easy Testing**
Test components in isolation:
```python
# Test strategy alone
mock_data = create_test_data()
signals = strategy.analyze(mock_data)
assert signals.any()

# Test risk manager alone
mock_signal = Signal(...)
approved = risk_manager.validate(mock_signal)
assert approved
```

### **3. Swappable Implementations**
Change components without touching others:
```python
# Swap data providers
registry.remove("data_provider")
registry.register_component("data_provider", AlpacaDataProvider())
# Everything else continues working

# Swap strategies
registry.remove("strategy")
registry.register_component("strategy", MLStrategy())
# System adapts automatically
```

### **4. Clear Data Flow**
```
Market → DataProvider → DATA_RECEIVED event
                ↓
         Strategy subscribes
                ↓
         SIGNAL_GENERATED event
                ↓
         RiskManager subscribes
                ↓
         ORDER_APPROVED event
                ↓
         Executor subscribes
                ↓
         TRADE_EXECUTED event
                ↓
         Analytics subscribes
                ↓
         Performance metrics
```

## 🔌 Integration Example

```python
# 1. Create components
data_provider = YFinanceProvider(config)
strategy = StrategyAdapter(config, momentum_strategy)
risk_manager = SimpleRiskManager(config)
executor = PaperTradingExecutor(config)

# 2. Register components
registry.register_component("data", data_provider)
registry.register_component("strategy", strategy)
registry.register_component("risk", risk_manager)
registry.register_component("executor", executor)

# 3. Wire up events
event_bus = get_event_bus()

# Strategy listens for data
event_bus.subscribe(EventType.DATA_RECEIVED, 
                   lambda e: process_data(e))

# Risk manager listens for signals
event_bus.subscribe(EventType.SIGNAL_GENERATED,
                   lambda e: validate_signal(e))

# 4. Start the system
registry.initialize_all()

# 5. System runs autonomously via events!
```

## 🚫 Problems Solved

### **Old System Issues:**
- ❌ 7 conflicting orchestrators
- ❌ 21 redundant execution engines
- ❌ Tight coupling everywhere
- ❌ Impossible to test in isolation
- ❌ 70% dead code
- ❌ No clear data flow

### **New System Solutions:**
- ✅ Zero orchestrators needed (event-driven)
- ✅ One executor interface (multiple implementations)
- ✅ Complete decoupling via events
- ✅ Every component testable alone
- ✅ 0% dead code
- ✅ Crystal clear data flow

## 📦 Component Status

### **Completed:**
- ✅ Core interfaces (IStrategy, IRiskManager, etc.)
- ✅ Event system (EventBus, Event types)
- ✅ Component registry (DI container)
- ✅ Data types (Signal, Order, Trade, etc.)
- ✅ Strategy adapter (connects existing strategies)

### **Ready to Build:**
- 🔨 Data providers (YFinance, Alpaca, etc.)
- 🔨 Risk managers (position limits, stop loss, etc.)
- 🔨 Portfolio allocators (equal weight, Kelly, etc.)
- 🔨 Executors (paper trading, live trading)
- 🔨 Analytics engines (Sharpe, drawdown, etc.)
- 🔨 Backtesting engine

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Build SimpleDataProvider** implementing IDataProvider
2. **Build SimpleRiskManager** implementing IRiskManager
3. **Build SimpleAllocator** implementing IPortfolioAllocator
4. **Build PaperExecutor** implementing IExecutor
5. **Connect everything via events**
6. **Run end-to-end test**

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Events over direct calls** → Prevents coupling
2. **Interfaces over implementations** → Enables swapping
3. **Registry over imports** → Centralized management
4. **Adapters for legacy code** → Reuse what works
5. **Types over dictionaries** → Type safety
