## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Documentation Status Warning**

**Last Updated: January 14, 2025**

**Important**: Many documentation files in this directory reference features that are **not yet operational**. The system is currently 75% functional and in active recovery. Please verify functionality before relying on examples or guides.

**Working Documentation**:
- Architecture and file structure descriptions are accurate
- Development guidelines and standards are current
- Basic usage patterns are correct (with caveats)

**Documentation Issues**:
- Example code may have import path issues
- Feature descriptions may overstate capabilities
- Integration guides may reference missing components

- [UX Enhancement Plan](UX_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md) - User experience improvements
- [User Interfaces](USER_INTERFACES.md) - Available interfaces
- [Paper Trading](PAPER_TRADING.md) - Paper trading setup and usage (‚ö†Ô∏è integration incomplete)
- [Optimization](OPTIMIZATION.md) - Performance optimization guide

### Sprint Planning
- [24 Week Sprint Master Plan](24_WEEK_SPRINT_MASTER_PLAN.md) - Long-term sprint planning
- [Sprint 1 Task Breakdown](SPRINT_1_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md) - Sprint 1 tasks
- [Sprint 2 Task Breakdown](SPRINT_2_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md) - Sprint 2 tasks

### Technical Reports
Reports on specific technical analyses and migrations are available in [reports/](reports/).

### Archives
Historical documentation including phase completions and weekly reports are archived in:
- [Phase Archives](archives/phases/) - Phase completion documentation
- [Weekly Archives](archives/weeks/) - Weekly progress reports
- [General Archives](archived/) - Other archived documentation

## üîç Quick Links

### Getting Started
1. **Start Here**: Read the main [README.md](../README.md) for current system status
2. Review [Development Guidelines](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md) (reliable)
3. Check [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues (useful)
4. **Verify Examples**: Test code snippets before using

### For Developers
1. [Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md) (structure accurate)
2. Main [README.md](../README.md) for honest capability assessment
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Expect 35+ test collection errors

### For Trading Strategy Development
1. **Current Reality**: Only 2 strategies operational (trend_breakout, demo_ma)
2. [Trading Strategy Roadmap](TRADING_STRATEGY_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) (aspirational)
3. Paper trading infrastructure incomplete

## üîÑ Documentation Maintenance

**Current Priority**: Aligning documentation with actual system capabilities

### Documentation Recovery Tasks
1. **Audit all guides** for feature claims vs reality
2. **Fix example code** with correct import paths
3. **Update capability statements** to reflect 75% functional status
4. **Mark speculative content** as future roadmap items

### For Contributors
- **Test all examples** before committing documentation
- **Use working import paths**: `from src.bot.` (with poetry run)
- **Be honest about capabilities** in all documentation
- **Mark incomplete features** clearly

## ‚úÖ Verified Documentation Status

| Document | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Main README.md | ‚úÖ Updated | Honest 75% functional assessment |
| Architecture guides | ‚úÖ Accurate | File structure and design correct |
| Development Guidelines | ‚úÖ Current | Standards and practices valid |
| Usage examples | ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed | Many have import path issues |
| Feature guides | ‚ö†Ô∏è Overstated | May claim non-operational features |
| Roadmaps | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optimistic | Timeline and completion claims inflated |

## üéØ Documentation Reality Check

**What Works in Documentation**:
- System architecture descriptions
- File organization and structure
- Development standards and practices
- Basic conceptual explanations

**What Needs Fixing**:
- Feature capability claims
- Example code import paths
- Integration tutorials
- Completion percentage statements

For the most accurate information about current capabilities, refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) which provides an honest assessment of the system's 75% functional status.
