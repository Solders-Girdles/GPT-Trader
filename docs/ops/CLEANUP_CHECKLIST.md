## Week 1: Reconcile & Map (Oct 5) ✅ **COMPLETE**

### ✅ Validation Checks
- [x] Check backups/ directory usage → **ACTIVE (Oct 4 timestamps)**
- [x] Locate BackupScheduler references → **Found in operations.py:221**
- [x] Identify operational directories → **backups/, logs/, cache/, data/, data_storage/**
- [x] Review dependency constraints → **numpy<2, websockets<16**

### ✅ Documentation Tasks
- [x] Create CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.md (this document)
- [x] Create CLEANUP_PROGRESS_REPORT.md
- [x] Create CODEBASE_HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md
- [x] Document dependency policy (numpy, websockets constraints)

### 🔍 Key Findings
1. **backups/** is ACTIVE - managed by BackupScheduler, contains timestamped backups
2. **logs/, cache/** are empty - safe for retention policy
3. **data/, data_storage/** contain structured data (universe/, metadata/, ohlcv/)
4. **Pre-commit already active** - hooks enforced on commits (discovered during execution)
5. **responses library available** - can mock Coinbase API for tests

**Commit:** `368eee0` - docs: Add Week 1 operational audit deliverables

**Deliverable:** `retention_policy.md` - 5 operational directories (backups/, logs/, cache/, data/, data_storage/)

### ✅ Cleanup Script (cleanup_artifacts.sh)
- [x] Implement --dry-run mode (default)
- [x] Add --confirm interactive mode

## 🚦 Risk Assessment

| Phase | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Week 1 | 🟢 LOW | Discovery only, no changes |
| Week 2 | 🟢 LOW | Dry-run mode, interim review |
| Week 3 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Integration tests might be flaky; use mocks initially |
| Week 4 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Pre-commit formatting; apply incrementally |

**Elevated Risks:**
1. **Operational Directory Deletion** - backups/ active
   - ✅ Mitigation: Confirmed BackupScheduler behavior; Week 2 dry-run validates
2. **Pre-commit Widespread Changes** - 692 Python files
   - ⏳ Mitigation: Apply by tool (black → ruff → mypy), commit in batches
3. **Soak Test Environment** - Sandbox might not be provisioned
   - ⏳ Mitigation: Validate access during Week 2; use local mocks if unavailable

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All operational directories have documented retention policies
- [ ] Cleanup script tested and operational (dry-run validated)
- [ ] Integration test coverage >70% for critical paths
- [ ] All docs reflect current architecture (Phases 0-3)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks active without breaking CI
- [ ] Trading ops validated in sandbox environment
- [ ] Monitoring documentation current and accurate
- [ ] Governance processes documented and communicated
- [ ] Retired feature flags removed from codebase

---

## 📅 Next Steps After Completion

1. Merge all PRs to main (after review)
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with cleanup summary
3. Archive plan documents to `docs/archive/cleanup-2025-q4/`
4. Conduct retrospective
5. Update runbooks with lessons learned
