# Archived Planning Documents

This directory contains historical planning documents that have been superseded by the consolidated [PROJECT_ROADMAP.md](../../../PROJECT_ROADMAP.md).

## Why These Were Archived

As of November 2025, the project had **three overlapping planning documents** that created confusion about priorities and current status. These have been consolidated into a single source of truth.

## Archived Documents

### COMPREHENSIVE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
- **Created**: ~October 2025
- **Purpose**: 12-month improvement roadmap with phased approach
- **Status**: Superseded by PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- **Value**: Historical context for long-term vision and success metrics

### TEST_REFACTORING_PLAN.md
- **Created**: ~October 2025
- **Purpose**: Detailed 3-phase test file refactoring specification
- **Status**: Phases 1-2 complete (75%), Phase 3 tracked in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- **Value**: Detailed implementation guide for test refactoring patterns

### PR_SUMMARY.md
- **Created**: ~November 2025
- **Purpose**: Summary of test refactoring Phases 1-2 completion
- **Status**: Work complete, documented in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- **Value**: Historical record of refactoring effort and validation

## Using These Documents
