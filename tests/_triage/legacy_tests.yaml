# Legacy test triage manifest.
#
# Keys are repo-relative file paths (use forward slashes).
# Values track whether a test file should be deleted or modernized.
#
# Example:
# tests/integration/test_some_old_thing.py:
#   action: delete  # or: modernize
#   status: todo    # optional: todo|in_progress|done
#   reason: "Why this is legacy or redundant"
#   owner: "name/handle"  # optional
#   added: "2026-01-18"   # optional (YYYY-MM-DD)

  tests/integration/test_simple_start.py:
    action: delete
    status: done
    reason: "Legacy bot startup test uses global container + heavy patching; redundant with newer TradingBot unit/integration coverage."
    added: "2026-01-19"
  tests/unit/gpt_trader/cli/test_cli_integration.py:
    action: delete
    status: done
    reason: "Subprocess-based CLI tests duplicated by focused unit tests (cli.main, command registration/parsing) and were not part of any CI suite."
    added: "2026-01-19"
  tests/unit/gpt_trader/app/test_health_server_integration.py:
    action: modernize
    status: todo
    reason: "Starts a live asyncio server with socket retries/sleeps inside unit suite; move to integration or refactor to a deterministic client/server fixture."
    added: "2026-01-19"
  tests/unit/gpt_trader/features/live_trade/engines/test_telemetry_health_edges.py:
    action: modernize
    status: todo
    reason: "High patch/monkeypatch density with many edge assertions; split into smaller focused tests and reduce mock scaffolding."
    added: "2026-01-19"
  tests/unit/gpt_trader/logging/test_setup_configure_logging_handlers.py:
    action: modernize
    status: todo
    reason: "Handler wiring relies on extensive patching and global logger state; consolidate into fewer integration-style checks or fixture-driven unit tests."
    added: "2026-01-19"
  tests/unit/gpt_trader/monitoring/test_heartbeat.py:
    action: modernize
    status: todo
    reason: "Relies on real time and asyncio sleeps in unit suite; replace with fake clock or move to integration."
    added: "2026-01-19"
  tests/unit/gpt_trader/monitoring/test_heartbeat_error_handling.py:
    action: modernize
    status: todo
    reason: "Uses real time/sleep loops for error handling; refactor to deterministic timing or integration-only coverage."
    added: "2026-01-19"
  tests/unit/gpt_trader/monitoring/test_status_reporter_file_output_and_integration.py:
    action: modernize
    status: todo
    reason: "Async background file writes with sleeps make unit runs slow/flaky; move to integration or use fake clock + in-memory IO."
    added: "2026-01-19"
  tests/unit/gpt_trader/tui/test_events_integration.py:
    action: modernize
    status: todo
    reason: "Runs Textual app loop to exercise event wiring; reclassify as integration or refactor to lightweight unit harness."
    added: "2026-01-19"
  tests/unit/gpt_trader/utilities/test_async_utils_integration_scenarios.py: # naming: allow
    action: modernize
    status: todo
    reason: "Integration scenarios depend on sleeps/time and concurrency; make deterministic with fake clock or relocate to integration."
