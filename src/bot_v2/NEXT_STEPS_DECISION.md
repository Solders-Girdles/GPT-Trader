## 🎲 Decision Matrix

| Factor | Path A | Path B | Path C |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Time to Market** | 🟢 2-3 weeks | 🟡 4-6 weeks | 🔴 2-3 months |
| **Complexity** | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 High |
| **Performance** | 🟡 Basic | 🟢 Advanced | 🟢 Advanced |
| **Scalability** | 🟡 Single user | 🟡 Single user | 🟢 Multi-user |
| **Revenue Potential** | 🟡 Personal | 🟡 Personal/Fund | 🟢 SaaS/Platform |

## 💡 My Recommendation

Based on what we've built, I recommend **Path B: Smart Money** for these reasons:

1. **Foundation is Ready**: Our architecture can easily support ML additions
2. **Competitive Edge**: ML will differentiate from basic algo traders
3. **Manageable Scope**: 4-6 weeks is reasonable for one developer
4. **High Impact**: ML can significantly improve returns
5. **Learning Opportunity**: Combines trading + AI effectively

### Suggested Hybrid Approach

**Week 1-2**: Do Path A basics (broker connection + logging)
**Week 3-5**: Add Path B ML features
**Week 6**: Deploy and validate

This gets you to production faster while still adding intelligence.

*The beauty of our vertical slice architecture is that you can always start with Path A and evolve to B or C later. Each slice can be enhanced independently without breaking others.*
