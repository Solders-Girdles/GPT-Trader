# Strategy Selector Refactor – Phase 4 Complete

**Date:** January 2026
**Phase:** Registry Integration & Handler Suites
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Pattern:** Compose → Delegate → Validate → Document

## Summary

Replaced the StrategySelector's legacy inline strategy logic with a registry-driven delegation model, promoting clear handler boundaries and simplifying orchestration. Established dedicated test suites for each handler to lock in behaviour and added selector-focused tests that assert delegation, filtering, and ranking outcomes.

### Metrics
- `strategy_selector.py`: 544 → 149 lines (−395 lines, −72.6%)
- New strategy handler tests: +12 targeted cases (3 per handler)
- Selector test updates: +3 delegation/ordering assertions, removed direct handler calls
- Adaptive-portfolio unit suite: 188 tests total (all passing)

### Highlights
- `StrategySelector` now accepts an injectable `strategy_registry` and constructs a default registry via `_build_default_registry()` that wires the four handlers.
- Inline `_momentum_strategy`, `_mean_reversion_strategy`, `_trend_following_strategy`, `_ml_enhanced_strategy`, `_filter_signals`, and related helpers removed in favour of handler delegation + shared `SignalFilter`/`PositionSizeCalculator` components.
- Selector unit tests rewired to use handler mocks, exercising registry delegation, warning path for unknown strategies, and ranking via filtered confidence ordering.
- New `tests/unit/bot_v2/features/adaptive_portfolio/strategies/` package covers momentum, mean reversion, trend following, and ML enhanced handlers with positive, guard-rail, and exception scenarios.
- `pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/features/adaptive_portfolio` executed successfully (188 PASSED in 0.16s).

## Changes Made

### Strategy Selector

- Constructor now accepts optional `SymbolUniverseBuilder`, `PositionSizeCalculator`, `SignalFilter`, and `strategy_registry` dependencies.
- Added `_build_default_registry()` that instantiates handlers and links the ML enhanced handler to momentum results.
- `generate_signals()` performs direct registry lookups, logs unknown strategies, and defers filtering to the shared `SignalFilter` implementation.
- Removed legacy helper methods and bespoke filtering logic, reducing cognitive load and eliminating duplicated strategy code.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/bot_v2/features/adaptive_portfolio/test_strategy_selector.py`
  - Introduced fixtures for registry mocks, universe builder, and signal filter.
  - Added delegation test verifying both handlers invoked and highest-confidence signal returned post-ranking.
  - Added warning-path test for unknown strategy names and ordering test ensuring ranking honours confidence.
  - Retained universe sizing, position sizing, and capacity cap coverage with updated collaborators.

- `tests/unit/bot_v2/features/adaptive_portfolio/strategies/`
  - `test_momentum_handler.py`: strong-trend buy, insufficient history guard, provider exception guard.
  - `test_mean_reversion_handler.py`: oversold buy, zero-volatility guard, provider exception guard.
  - `test_trend_following_handler.py`: aligned MA buy, insufficient history guard, provider exception guard.
  - `test_ml_enhanced_handler.py`: confidence boost, low-confidence filter, empty momentum passthrough.
  - Shared fixtures via `conftest.py` provide simple frame adapter, micro-tier config, snapshot, and position-size calculator mock.

## Validation

```
pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/features/adaptive_portfolio
============================= test session starts ==============================
... collected 188 items
... 188 passed in 0.16s
```

All adaptive-portfolio unit tests pass, and StrategySelector line count now sits well under the ≈200-line target with handler responsibilities isolated.
