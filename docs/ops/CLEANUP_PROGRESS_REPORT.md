# Cleanup Progress Report - Q4 2025

**Report Date:** 2025-10-05
**Branch:** `cleanup/operational-audit-q4-2025`
**Overall Status:** üü¢ On Track (Week 1 Day 1)

---

## Executive Summary

Operational audit and cleanup initiative launched to:
1. Establish retention policies for operational directories
2. Build integration test coverage for critical trading paths
3. Sync documentation with Phase 0-3 refactoring
4. Activate governance tooling (pre-commit, dependency management)
5. Validate trading operations in sandbox environment

**Current Phase:** Week 1 - Reconcile & Map (Discovery)
**Progress:** 25% complete (validation checks done, creating tracking docs)

---

## Week 1: Reconcile & Map (Oct 5-11)

### Completed ‚úÖ

**Validation Checks (Oct 5)**
- ‚úÖ Confirmed `backups/` directory is ACTIVE
  - Contains timestamped backups from Oct 4, 2025
  - Pattern: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS (e.g., 20251004_151054)
  - Used by BackupScheduler in `src/bot_v2/state/backup/operations.py:221`
  - **Decision:** Must retain backups/, create lifecycle retention policy

- ‚úÖ Identified operational directories:
  ```
  backups/         ‚Üí ACTIVE (BackupScheduler managed)
  logs/            ‚Üí Empty (safe for cleanup policy)
  cache/           ‚Üí Empty (safe for cleanup policy)
  data/            ‚Üí Contains universe/ (active trading data)
  data_storage/    ‚Üí Contains metadata/, ohlcv/ (empty, archival structure)
  .mypy_cache      ‚Üí Tool cache (safe to gitignore)
  .pytest_cache    ‚Üí Tool cache (safe to gitignore)
  .ruff_cache      ‚Üí Tool cache (safe to gitignore)
  ```

- ‚úÖ Documented dependency constraints:
  - `numpy>=1.26.4,<2.0.0` - Pinned below v2 for pandas/pydantic compatibility
  - `websockets>=12.0,<16.0` - Constrained by coinbase-advanced-py <14.0
  - `python>=3.12,<3.13` - Project Python version
  - `responses>=0.25.8` - Available for Coinbase API mocking

- ‚úÖ Created cleanup branch: `cleanup/operational-audit-q4-2025`

- ‚úÖ Created tracking document: `docs/ops/CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.md`

### In Progress üîÑ

- üîÑ Creating `docs/ops/CLEANUP_PROGRESS_REPORT.md` (this document)
- üîÑ Creating `docs/ops/CODEBASE_HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md`

### Pending ‚è≥

- ‚è≥ Document dependency policy in `docs/ops/dependency_policy.md`
- ‚è≥ Review existing refactoring docs for context
- ‚è≥ Survey Python file count and test coverage baseline

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Keep backups/ directory | Active BackupScheduler usage confirmed | Week 2 retention policy required |
| Use responses library for mocks | Already in dependencies, mature HTTP mocking | Faster integration test development |
| Incremental pre-commit rollout | 692 Python files risk widespread changes | Safer adoption, batched commits |

## Week 2: Operational Audit & Test Design (Oct 12-18)

**Status:** ‚è≥ Not Started

**Blockers:** None identified

**Planned Deliverables:**
- Retention policy document for all operational directories
- cleanup_artifacts.sh script with dry-run, confirm, backup modes
- Integration test plan document (reviewed by QA + trading engineers)
- Coinbase sandbox API access confirmation

**Risks:**
- üü° MEDIUM: Sandbox environment might not be provisioned
  - Mitigation: Validate access early; use mocks if unavailable

---

## Week 3: Integration Coverage & Doc Sync (Oct 19-25)

**Status:** ‚è≥ Not Started

**Blockers:** Depends on Week 2 test plan approval

**Planned Deliverables:**
- Integration tests for brokerages, orchestration, streaming
- pytest.ini updated with integration/slow/soak markers
- ARCHITECTURE.md updated with Phase 0-3 extractions
- README.md quickstart validated
- REFACTORING_2025_RUNBOOK.md feature flags audited

**Risks:**
- üü° MEDIUM: Integration tests may be flaky initially
  - Mitigation: Start with mocks, add live tests incrementally

---

## Week 4: Governance & Validation (Oct 26 - Nov 2)

**Status:** ‚è≥ Not Started

**Blockers:** Depends on Week 3 completion

**Planned Deliverables:**
- Pre-commit hooks activated incrementally (black ‚Üí ruff ‚Üí mypy)
- Trading ops validation complete (account snapshot, soak tests)
- Monitoring documentation validated
- Governance docs created (governance.md, dependency_policy.md)
- Retired feature flags removed

**Risks:**
- üü° MEDIUM: Pre-commit may surface widespread formatting issues
  - Mitigation: Apply by tool, commit in batches, review with `git add -p`

---

## Metrics & Progress

### Overall Progress
- **Week 1:** 25% (validation done, docs in progress)
- **Week 2:** 0%
- **Week 3:** 0%
- **Week 4:** 0%
- **Total:** 6% (1.25 / 20 major tasks)

### Codebase Statistics (Baseline)
```
Python files: 692 (estimated from ruff config)
Test coverage: 85.52% (global minimum: 85%)
Pre-commit: Installed but not activated
Integration tests: Minimal (basic structure exists)
```

### Validation Results
```bash
# Operational directories
backups/         8 timestamped directories (active)
logs/            0 files
cache/           0 files
data/universe/   Active trading data
data_storage/    Empty archival structure

# Dependency constraints
numpy            1.26.4 < 2.0.0  ‚úÖ Pinned
websockets       12.0 - 16.0     ‚úÖ Constrained
coinbase-adv-py  >=1.8.2,<2.0.0  ‚úÖ Stable
```

## Issues & Blockers

| Issue | Severity | Status | Mitigation |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| Sandbox environment access unknown | üü° MEDIUM | Open | Week 2: Validate early; use mocks as fallback |
| Pre-commit impact unknown | üü° MEDIUM | Open | Week 4: Test report phase before applying |
| Feature flag cleanup scope unclear | üü¢ LOW | Open | Week 1: Grep for retired flags |

---

## Next Actions (This Week)

1. ‚úÖ Complete CLEANUP_PROGRESS_REPORT.md
2. ‚è≥ Complete CODEBASE_HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md
3. ‚è≥ Create docs/ops/dependency_policy.md
4. ‚è≥ Grep for retired feature flags:
   - `USE_NEW_MARKET_DATA_SERVICE`
   - `USE_NEW_STREAMING_SERVICE`
5. ‚è≥ Review REFACTORING_2025_RUNBOOK.md for context
6. ‚è≥ Check pytest.ini current configuration

---

## Retrospective Notes

**What's Working Well:**
- Clear plan with weekly milestones
- Risk mitigation built into each phase
- Interim review gates prevent runaway work

**Concerns:**
- Sandbox access unknown (critical for Week 2-4)
- Pre-commit impact uncertain (could be 100+ file changes)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Early validation (backups/ check) prevented potential disaster
- Dependency constraint context critical for stability
