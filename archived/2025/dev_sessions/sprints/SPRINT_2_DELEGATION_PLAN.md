## 💡 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Pipeline latency >100ms | Medium | High | Implement caching, parallel execution | data-pipeline-engineer |
| A/B test false positives | Low | High | Multiple testing correction, larger samples | backtest-engineer |
| Retraining causes degradation | Medium | High | A/B test before deployment, rollback | model-trainer |
| Memory leaks in pipeline | Low | Medium | Resource monitoring, cleanup | monitoring-specialist |

### Coordination Risks
- **Agent conflicts**: Vertical slice architecture minimizes this
- **Communication overhead**: Use unified pipeline as integration point
- **Testing bottleneck**: Start test development early (Day 3)
