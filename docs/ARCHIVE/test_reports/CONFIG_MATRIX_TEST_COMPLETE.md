# Config Matrix Test Enhancement Complete

## Summary
Successfully enhanced the config matrix tests with passphrase selection verification and confirmed all tests are passing.

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Passphrase Selection Verification
Tests now verify that the correct passphrase is selected based on environment:
- Production tests verify `COINBASE_PROD_API_PASSPHRASE` is used
- Sandbox tests verify `COINBASE_SANDBOX_API_PASSPHRASE` is used
- Fallback tests verify `COINBASE_API_PASSPHRASE` is used when specific ones aren't set

### 2. API Mode Verification
Tests now verify that sandbox mode forces Exchange API mode:
```python
assert api_config.api_mode == "exchange"  # Verify sandbox forces exchange mode
```

### 3. Environment Variable Documentation
README already contains comprehensive environment variable precedence documentation at lines 210-227, including:
- Production vs Sandbox credential selection
- CDP key fallbacks for Advanced Trade API
- API mode auto-selection behavior

## Test Results
All 4 config matrix tests passing:
```
✅ test_brokerage_creation_with_prod_keys
✅ test_brokerage_creation_with_sandbox_keys
✅ test_brokerage_creation_with_fallback_keys_for_prod
✅ test_brokerage_creation_with_fallback_keys_for_sandbox
```

## CI Integration
The tests run in CI with a matrix strategy covering all scenarios:
- `prod`: Production with specific keys
- `sandbox`: Sandbox with specific keys  
- `prod_fallback`: Production with fallback keys
- `sandbox_fallback`: Sandbox with fallback keys

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All enhancements implemented and verified.

## Next Steps
Two options remain from Phase 2:

**Option A: Fund Exchange Sandbox**
- Add funds to sandbox account to complete order lifecycle testing
- Verify full order flow (create → fill → position → close)

**Option B: Production Canary**
- Proceed with ultra-safe production testing using canary profile
- Leverage strict guards and reduce-only mode for safety
