# Trading Strategy Development Roadmap

## 🎯 **Current Situation Analysis**

GPT-Trader has **excellent infrastructure** (Phases 1-4 complete) but faces **strategy development bottlenecks** preventing effective trading strategy training, testing, and deployment.

### ✅ **What We Have (Strengths)**
- **Institutional-grade infrastructure**: Real-time data, order management, risk monitoring
- **Advanced optimization framework**: Multi-objective evolution, portfolio optimization
- **Production-ready orchestrator**: Live trading coordination and monitoring
- **Comprehensive testing**: 1,100+ tests with 90% success rate
- **Event-driven architecture**: High-throughput messaging and coordination

### 🚫 **Critical Obstacles (Bottlenecks)**

## 🔴 **Primary Obstacles**

### **1. Strategy Collection & Validation Gap**
**Problem**: We have sophisticated infrastructure but insufficient **validated trading strategies** ready for deployment.

**Current State**:
- Only 4 basic strategies: `demo_ma.py`, `trend_breakout.py`, `enhanced_trend_breakout.py`
- No systematic strategy validation pipeline from research → paper → live
- Missing standardized performance benchmarking across strategy candidates

**Impact**: Can't populate our sophisticated selection and orchestration systems

### **2. Market Data Integration Bottleneck**
**Problem**: Real-time infrastructure exists but **historical data pipeline** for strategy training is incomplete.

**Current State**:
- Phase 4 real-time data pipeline (WebSocket/REST) implemented
- Historical data relies on basic yfinance integration
- No standardized dataset preparation for strategy training/validation
- Missing data quality validation and cleaning pipeline

**Impact**: Can't train strategies on clean, consistent historical datasets

### **3. Strategy Training & Validation Pipeline Missing**
**Problem**: No systematic pipeline from **strategy development → validation → paper trading → live deployment**.

**Current State**:
- Individual strategy backtesting exists
- Missing automated validation workflows (walk-forward, out-of-sample testing)
- No standardized strategy performance comparison and ranking
- Missing risk-adjusted strategy evaluation metrics

**Impact**: Can't systematically develop and validate strategies for production

### **4. Portfolio of Strategies Management**
**Problem**: Infrastructure assumes we have multiple strategies but no **strategy portfolio management** system.

**Current State**:
- Strategy selection framework exists but needs strategy candidates
- Missing strategy correlation analysis and portfolio construction
- No strategy capacity management and allocation limits
- Missing strategy lifecycle management (deployment, monitoring, retirement)

**Impact**: Can't effectively manage multiple strategies as a portfolio

## 🟡 **Secondary Obstacles**

### **5. Alternative Data Integration Incomplete**
**Problem**: Phase 3 alternative data framework exists but **data sources not connected**.

**Current State**:
- Framework for news sentiment, economic indicators, ESG metrics
- No actual data source integrations (Twitter, news APIs, economic calendars)
- Missing feature engineering pipeline for alternative datasets

**Impact**: Strategies limited to price/volume data only

### **6. Regime Detection Not Operational**
**Problem**: Regime detection mentioned in documentation but **not implemented operationally**.

**Current State**:
- Basic regime labeling exists in intelligence framework
- No real-time regime classification affecting strategy selection
- Missing regime-aware strategy performance analysis

**Impact**: Strategies can't adapt to changing market conditions
