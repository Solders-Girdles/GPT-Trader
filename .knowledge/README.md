# Core Knowledge Layer

This directory contains the single source of truth for system state.

## Files

- **PROJECT_STATE.json** - Current component status and capabilities
- **SYSTEM_REALITY.md** - What actually works vs what's claimed
- **KNOWN_FAILURES.md** - Error patterns and proven solutions
- **ROADMAP.json** - Current development focus and milestones

## Usage

These files are the authoritative source for:
- What components are working/broken
- How to fix common errors
- What to work on next

Always update these when system state changes.
