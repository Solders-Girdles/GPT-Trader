# Claude Agent Notes

All core orientation details now live in `docs/agents/Agents.md`. Keep that doc open while you work.

## Claude-Specific Tips
- Start with the planning tool when tasks span multiple slices; call out your plan explicitly in replies.
- Surface risk-impact summaries and testing commands in every response so maintainers can assess changes quickly.
- Prefer `rg`/`fd` for navigationâ€”large `grep`/`find` calls slow the Mac mini CI boxes.
