# Archived Configuration Profiles

These configuration files are retained for historical reference only.
They are no longer wired into automation or documentation.

The Stage 1/2 scale-up manifests now live exclusively under
`config/stage1_scaleup.yaml` and `config/stage2_scaleup.yaml`. Restore
legacy variants from git history if you need to revisit the retired
experiments without drifting from the canonical configs.

As of September 2024 no archived manifests remain in this directory;
keep this README to document the retrieval path and rehydrate files
directly from repository history when necessary.
