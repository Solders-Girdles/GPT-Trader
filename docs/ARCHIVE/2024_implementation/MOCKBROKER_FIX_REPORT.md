# MockBroker Interface Alignment Report

**Date:** 2025-08-31  
**Objective:** Align MockBroker class with IBrokerage interface to fix AttributeErrors in developer smoke test

## Executive Summary

Successfully aligned the MockBroker implementation with the IBrokerage interface by implementing the required methods and maintaining backward compatibility for existing code that hasn't been updated yet.

## Root Cause Analysis

The MockBroker class had methods that were out of sync with the production IBrokerage interface:
1. Had `get_positions()` instead of `list_positions()`
2. Had `get_account()` instead of `list_balances()`  
3. `get_quote()` returned `last` instead of `last_price`

Additionally, some production code still uses the old method names, requiring backward compatibility.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Position Methods
- **Added:** `list_positions()` - New IBrokerage-compliant method
- **Kept:** `get_positions()` - For backward compatibility with existing code

```python
def list_positions(self):
    """Get mock positions compatible with IBrokerage interface."""
    return list(self.positions.values())
    
def get_positions(self):
    """Get mock positions for backward compatibility."""
    return list(self.positions.values())
```

### 2. Balance/Account Methods
- **Added:** `list_balances()` - New IBrokerage-compliant method returning list of balances
- **Kept:** `get_account()` - For backward compatibility with existing code

```python
def list_balances(self):
    """Get mock balances compatible with IBrokerage interface."""
    return [SimpleNamespace(asset='USD', available=self.equity, total=self.equity, hold=Decimal('0'))]
    
def get_account(self):
    """Get mock account info for backward compatibility."""
    return SimpleNamespace(
        equity=self.equity,
        balance=self.equity,
        cash=self.equity * Decimal("0.5"),
        buying_power=self.equity * Decimal("2"),
        portfolio_value=self.equity
    )
```

### 3. Quote Method
- **Fixed:** `get_quote()` now returns `last_price` instead of `last`

```python
def get_quote(self, symbol: str):
    """Get mock quote with realistic bid/ask spread."""
    price = self.marks.get(symbol, Decimal("1000"))
    spread = price * Decimal("0.0001")
    
    return SimpleNamespace(
        symbol=symbol,
        last_price=price,  # Changed from 'last'
        bid=price - spread,
        ask=price + spread,
        ts=datetime.now()
    )
```

## Validation Results

### Developer Smoke Test
```bash
poetry run perps-bot --profile dev --dev-fast
```

**Result:** âœ… SUCCESS
- Exit code: 0
- Bot initializes successfully
- State reconciliation completes
- Symbols are processed without errors
- Clean shutdown

### Test Output
```
2025-08-31 02:11:37,000 - Bot Status - Profile: dev - Equity: $100000 - Positions: 0
2025-08-31 02:11:37,000 -   BTC-PERP: hold (No signal)
2025-08-31 02:11:37,000 -   ETH-PERP: hold (No signal)
2025-08-31 02:11:37,000 - Shutting down bot...
Exit code: 0
```

## Backward Compatibility Strategy

The implementation maintains both new interface methods and old methods to ensure:
1. **New code** can use the IBrokerage-compliant methods
2. **Existing code** continues to work without immediate refactoring
3. **Gradual migration** is possible without breaking functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Gradual Refactoring:** Update production code to use new method names
   - Replace `get_positions()` calls with `list_positions()`
   - Replace `get_account()` calls with `list_balances()`
   
2. **Remove Deprecated Methods:** Once all code is updated, remove:
   - `get_positions()` 
   - `get_account()`

3. **Interface Enforcement:** Consider adding abstract base class to enforce interface compliance

## Conclusion

The MockBroker is now fully aligned with the IBrokerage interface while maintaining backward compatibility. The developer smoke test runs successfully with exit code 0, confirming the repository health initiative is complete.
