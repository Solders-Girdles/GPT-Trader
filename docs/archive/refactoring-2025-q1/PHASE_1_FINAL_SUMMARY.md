## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Went Well:

1. **Test Pattern Reuse**
   - Async task patterns from core work applied to lifecycle tests
   - Concurrency patterns from streaming tests applied to update_marks
   - Established patterns accelerated extended scope

2. **Strategic Ordering**
   - Easy tests first built confidence
   - Medium tests leveraged existing patterns
   - Complex tests completed efficiently with momentum

3. **Pragmatic Short Soak**
   - Full 48H unnecessary at this stage (mock broker, no metrics endpoint)
   - 2H soak sufficient to validate stability
   - Deferred full review to production readiness (post-Phase 2)

4. **No Scope Creep**
   - Stuck to converting existing placeholders
   - Each test had clear purpose and pattern
   - No feature additions, pure characterization

### Best Practices Established:

1. **Lifecycle Testing**
   - Always verify background tasks spawn correctly
   - Always verify cleanup doesn't hang
   - Always mock async tasks for deterministic tests

2. **Concurrency Testing**
   - Use `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent async calls
   - Always verify no corruption (type checks, length checks)
   - Use large MA values to prevent trimming interference

3. **Error Testing**
   - Use multi-symbol configs to test partial failures
   - Always verify successful symbols unaffected
   - Always verify failed symbols don't corrupt state

4. **Deployment Validation**
   - Disable HTTP health checks for CLI mode
   - Use process-based checks when possible
   - Container restart policy handles crashes
