# üîÑ Agent Delegation Workflows

## Core Delegation Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each agent owns ONE primary domain. They delegate outside their expertise.

### 2. Hierarchical Escalation
Issues escalate up, work flows down:
```
Strategic ‚Üí Operational ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation
```

### 3. Parallel When Possible
Independent tasks run simultaneously to maximize efficiency.

## Standard Workflows

### üöÄ New Feature Development

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[planner]
    B --> C[tech-lead-orchestrator]
    C --> D{Architecture Impact?}

```

**Delegation Chain:**

    F --> G[risk-analyst]

3. **data-pipeline-engineer**: Prepares data
4. **model-trainer**: Trains models
5. **backtest-engineer**: Validates performance
6. **risk-analyst**: Assesses risk
7. **trading-ops-lead**: Deploys to production

### üîß System Optimization

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Performance Issue] --> B[performance-optimizer]
    B --> C{Type?}
    C -->|Code| D[backend-developer]
    C -->|Data| E[data-pipeline-engineer]
    C -->|Infra| F[devops-lead]
    D --> G[code-reviewer]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[test-runner]
```

**Delegation Chain:**
1. **performance-optimizer**: Identifies bottlenecks
2. **Specialized developer**: Implements optimization
3. **code-reviewer**: Reviews changes
4. **test-runner**: Validates improvements

## Parallel Execution Patterns

### Simultaneous Analysis
When analyzing a system, these agents work in parallel:
```python
parallel_agents = [
    "code-archaeologist",    # Code analysis
    "trading-strategy-consultant",  # Strategy review
    "risk-analyst",          # Risk assessment
    "performance-optimizer"  # Performance check
]
```

### Parallel Development
Different components developed simultaneously:
```python
parallel_development = [
    "frontend-developer",    # UI work
    "backend-developer",     # API work
    "data-pipeline-engineer" # Data work
]
```

### Parallel Testing
Multiple test types run concurrently:
```python
parallel_testing = [
    "test-runner",          # Unit tests
    "adversarial-dummy",    # Edge cases
    "backtest-engineer"     # Historical validation
]
```

## Decision Points & Escalation

### When to Escalate

| Situation | Escalate To | Reason |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Architecture change | tech-lead-orchestrator | System-wide impact |
| Risk limit breach | risk-analyst ‚Üí trading-ops-lead | Immediate action needed |
| Production issue | devops-lead | Infrastructure expertise |
| Strategy conflict | trading-strategy-consultant | Domain expertise |
| ML model drift | ml-strategy-director | Specialized knowledge |
| Security concern | code-reviewer ‚Üí devops-lead | Security priority |

### Veto Powers

Certain agents can block progress:
- **risk-analyst**: Can halt any strategy or trade
- **trading-strategy-consultant**: Can reject strategy logic
- **tech-lead-orchestrator**: Can block architecture changes
- **devops-lead**: Can prevent deployments
- **code-reviewer**: Can reject code changes

## Workflow Automation

2. data-pipeline-engineer ‚Üí Data quality report
3. risk-analyst ‚Üí Risk metrics calculation
4. trading-ops-lead ‚Üí Strategy activation

# Pre-deployment Workflow
1. test-runner ‚Üí Run test suite
2. code-reviewer ‚Üí Security scan

# Incident Response Workflow
1. monitoring-specialist ‚Üí Detect issue
2. devops-lead ‚Üí Assess severity

```

## Best Practices

### DO's
‚úÖ Delegate to specialists for their domain
‚úÖ Run independent tasks in parallel
‚úÖ Provide clear context in handoffs
‚úÖ Escalate blockers quickly
‚úÖ Document decisions made

### DON'Ts
‚ùå Skip specialists to save time
‚ùå Delegate without context
‚ùå Create circular dependencies
‚ùå Ignore veto powers
‚ùå Proceed without required approvals
