- ✅ **pytest tests** passing (4/4 in test_foundation.py)

## Impact Metrics

### Before Cleanup
- Root directory: 20+ markdown files mixed legacy/current
- Documentation scattered across multiple locations
- Contradictory Alpaca/equities references throughout
- AI agents encountering conflicting information

### After Cleanup
- **Root**: Reduced to 10 essential .md files
- **docs/**: Clear hierarchy with current documentation
- **docs/archive/**: 14 legacy files preserved with deprecation notices
- **Zero contradictory references** in active documentation

## Verification Commands Passed

```bash
✅ pwd                                              # Correct directory

✅ wc -l README.md                                  # 125 lines
✅ grep '"broker":' .knowledge/STATE.json           # "coinbase"
✅ poetry run perps-bot --help                      # Command works
✅ poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_foundation.py  # 4 tests pass
✅ grep -r "alpaca" docs/ --exclude-dir=archive    # No results

```

## Key Achievements

1. **Eliminated agent confusion** from contradictory Alpaca/equities information
2. **Established single source of truth** in docs/ directory
3. **Clear Coinbase/Perpetuals focus** throughout all documentation
4. **Preserved history** in properly archived and deprecated files
5. **Vendor-neutral naming** for broader AI agent compatibility

## Conclusion

The documentation cleanup is **100% complete**. All objectives have been achieved:
- Legacy documentation properly archived with deprecation notices
- Current documentation reflects Coinbase Perpetuals focus exclusively
- No contradictory references remain in active documentation
- All systems functional and tests passing

The documentation now accurately represents the current Coinbase Perpetuals implementation without any confusing legacy references that could mislead AI agents or developers.
