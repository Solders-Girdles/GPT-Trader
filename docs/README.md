## üö¶ Start Here

1. **[Quick Start](QUICK_START.md)** ‚Äì spin up the dev stack with the new `Makefile` helpers.
2. **[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)** ‚Äì understand the vertical slices before touching code.
3. **[Monitoring Playbook](MONITORING_PLAYBOOK.md)** ‚Äì wire dashboards and alerts prior to live trading.

## üìç Quick Links

- **[Quick Start](QUICK_START.md)** - Development bootstrap + core commands
- **[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design and capabilities
- **[Monitoring Playbook](MONITORING_PLAYBOOK.md)** - Metrics, alerting, dashboards
- **[Complete Setup Guide](guides/complete_setup_guide.md)** - Full installation and configuration
- **[Coinbase Reference](reference/coinbase_complete.md)** - Complete integration documentation
- **[AI Agent Guide](guides/agents.md)** - For AI agents and automation

## üìö Core Documentation

### Getting Started
- [Quick Start](QUICK_START.md) - Local workflow with `make` and Compose profiles
- [Complete Setup Guide](guides/complete_setup_guide.md) - Everything from installation to first trade
- [Testing Guide](guides/testing.md) - Running and writing tests
- [Behavioral Scenario Utilities](testing/behavioral_scenarios_demo.md) - Deterministic demos for docs/tutorials

### Architecture & Design
- [System Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Component overview
- [Perpetuals Trading Logic](reference/trading_logic_perps.md) - Future-ready INTX implementation details
- [Orchestration Bootstrap](src/bot_v2/orchestration/bootstrap.py) - Shared bot wiring helpers
- Historical slice diagrams can be recovered from repository history if needed.
- Legacy acceptance/performance/system suites were removed from the tree; recover them from git history if you need the old coverage. The active CI target is `poetry run pytest`, which exercises the `bot_v2` codebase.

### Trading Operations
- [Monitoring Playbook](MONITORING_PLAYBOOK.md) - Metrics, alerting, and dashboards
- [Production Deployment](guides/production.md) - Deployment guide (spot-first, INTX-gated perps)
- [Operations Runbook](ops/operations_runbook.md) - Operational procedures

### Development
- [AI Agent Guide](guides/agents.md) - For Claude and other AI agents
- [Development Guidelines](../DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md) - Standards for contributing
- [Contributing Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) - Development workflow

## üîß Configuration & Setup

### API Configuration
- [Coinbase Complete Reference](reference/coinbase_complete.md) - All Coinbase integration documentation
- [Environment Template](../config/environments/.env.template) - Environment variables template

### Trading Profiles
- **Development** - Mock broker, deterministic fills
- **Canary** - Ultra-safe production testing
- **Production** - Full trading capabilities

## üìä Reports & Analysis

### Implementation Status
- [Production Readiness](guides/production.md#production-readiness-requirements)
- [System Capabilities](reference/system_capabilities.md) - Current state overview
- [System Reality](reference/system_reality.md) - Honest current state assessment
- [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](reference/compatibility_troubleshooting.md) - Technical requirements
- [Tooling Library](tooling/README.md) - Consolidated tooling analyses and quick references
- Historical validation analysis is available in version control history.

### Performance & Operations
- [Operations Runbook](ops/operations_runbook.md) - Daily operations and monitoring
- Performance-tuning playbooks were removed from the tree; consult git history if
  you need the legacy guidance.

## üóÑÔ∏è Archive

### Legacy Documentation
Historical documentation was removed from the repository to keep the tree lean.
Use git history if you need to recover earlier runbooks or reports.

## üö® Important Notes

### Production vs Sandbox

| Environment | Products | API | Authentication |
|------------|----------|-----|----------------|
| **Production (default)** | Spot (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, ‚Ä¶) | Advanced Trade v3 (HMAC) | API key/secret |
| **Production (perps)** | Perpetuals (INTX-gated) | Advanced Trade v3 | CDP (JWT) + `COINBASE_ENABLE_DERIVATIVES=1` |
| **Sandbox** | Not used for live trading (API diverges) | ‚Äî | Use only with `PERPS_PAPER=1` |

**Critical:** Sandbox does **not** support perpetuals. The bot defaults to spot trading and only enables perps when INTX access plus derivatives flag are detected.

### Current Focus
- **Primary**: Coinbase spot trading (perps code paths kept future-ready)
- **Architecture**: Vertical slice design (production vs experimental slices clearly marked)
- **ML**: Strategy selection, regime detection, Kelly sizing (experimental slices)
- **Testing**: 1555 collected / 1554 selected tests (`poetry run pytest --collect-only`)

## üìû Getting Help

- **Quick Questions**: Check [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)
- **Architecture**: Review [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **AI Development**: See [guides/agents.md](guides/agents.md)
- **Issues**: GitHub Issues page
