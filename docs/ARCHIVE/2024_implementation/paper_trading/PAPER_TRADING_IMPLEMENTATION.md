# Paper Trading Implementation with Coinbase

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive paper trading system that uses **real-time Coinbase market data** for realistic trading simulation. This allows us to test strategies with actual bid/ask spreads, market conditions, and price movements before risking real capital.

## What We Built

### 1. Basic Paper Trading (`paper_trade_coinbase.py`)
- **Real-time quotes** from Coinbase CDP API
- **Realistic execution** with actual bid/ask spreads
- **Commission modeling** (0.6% Coinbase fee)
- **Slippage simulation** (0.1%)
- **Position tracking** with P&L calculation
- **Risk management** (stop-loss, take-profit)
- **Results logging** to JSON files

### 2. Advanced Strategy Testing (`paper_trade_strategies_coinbase.py`)
- **5 Trading Strategies Implemented:**
  - **Momentum**: Trades based on price momentum over time
  - **Mean Reversion**: Uses Bollinger Bands for overbought/oversold signals
  - **Breakout**: Identifies price breakouts from recent ranges
  - **MA Crossover**: Classic moving average crossover strategy
  - **Volatility**: Adapts to market volatility conditions

- **Features:**
  - Price history collection for technical indicators
  - Strategy comparison mode
  - Real-time position management
  - Automatic stop-loss/take-profit
  - Performance metrics tracking

## Key Components

### Safety Features
1. **Position Limits**: Maximum 25% per position, max 4-5 concurrent positions
2. **Cash Reserve**: Always maintains 5% cash buffer
3. **Stop Loss**: Automatic 5% stop-loss on all positions
4. **Take Profit**: Automatic 10% take-profit targets
5. **Commission & Slippage**: Realistic 0.6% commission + 0.1% slippage

### Data Integration
- **Live Market Data**: Real bid/ask from Coinbase
- **773 Trading Pairs**: Access to all Coinbase products
- **Sub-second Updates**: Real-time price feeds
- **Spread Analysis**: Actual market spreads used for execution

## Usage Examples

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test connection and get quotes
python scripts/paper_trade_coinbase.py --duration 0
```

### Run Single Strategy
```bash
# Run momentum strategy for 10 minutes
python scripts/paper_trade_strategies_coinbase.py --strategy momentum --duration 10
```

### Compare All Strategies
```bash
# Compare all 5 strategies over 30 minutes
python scripts/paper_trade_strategies_coinbase.py --compare --duration 30
```

## Performance Metrics Tracked

- **Total Return**: Percentage gain/loss
- **Max Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Number of Trades**: Total trades executed
- **Average Win/Loss**: Average profit per winning/losing trade
- **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profit to gross loss
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns (when sufficient data)

## Results Storage

All trading results are saved to `/results/` directory:
- `coinbase_paper_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`: Individual session results
- `strategy_comparison_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`: Strategy comparison results
