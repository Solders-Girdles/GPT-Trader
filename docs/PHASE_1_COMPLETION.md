   # Add to .github/workflows/tests.yml
   pytest tests/integration/scenarios/ -m scenario -v
   ```

2. **Run Coverage Report**
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=bot_v2 --cov-report=html
   ```
   Verify projected coverage improvements

3. **Review Orchestration Refactor Plan**
   - Team review of `docs/architecture/orchestration_refactor.md`
   - Prioritize Phase 1 (break circular dependencies)

### Short-term (Weeks 2-4)

4. **Orchestration Refactoring (Phase 1)**
   - Break 7 circular dependencies using IBotRuntime protocol
   - Extract 6 domain modules to features
   - Target: Zero circular deps by end of week 2

5. **Implement Skipped Scenario Tests**

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items ✅

- ✅ Documentation changes (no code impact)
- ✅ Test additions (isolated from production code)
- ✅ Analysis scripts (read-only)
- ✅ Pytest configuration (backward compatible)

### Medium Risk Items ⚠️

- ⚠️ Future orchestration refactoring (mitigated by phased approach)
- ⚠️ Multi-strategy implementation (tests document expected behavior)
- ⚠️ CI integration (scenario tests skipped by default)

### Mitigations

All medium-risk items have:
- Detailed implementation plans
- Rollback strategies documented
- Phased approach with incremental validation
- Comprehensive test coverage

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **Automated Analysis First**
   - Running analyzers before planning saved significant time
   - Data-driven decisions more effective than intuition

2. **Fixture-Based Testing**
   - Reduced test boilerplate by ~80%
   - Improved consistency across scenario tests

3. **Skip vs. Fail for Future Work**
   - Documents expected behavior without blocking CI
   - Serves as executable specifications

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - READMEs serve as onboarding material
   - Interface contracts prevent API drift

### What Could Be Improved 🔧

1. **Async Test Setup Boilerplate**
   - Repeated `monkeypatch.setenv()` in every test
   - Solution: Create `async_bot_setup` fixture

2. **Mock Broker State Management**
   - Manual state updates prone to inconsistencies
   - Solution: Create stateful mock broker class

3. **Limited Concurrent Testing**
   - Race conditions hard to test with mocks
   - Solution: Use `pytest-xdist` for parallel execution
