## Key Findings at a Glance

### Solid Components (Production-Ready)
- **Async Tools**: Retry, rate limiting, caching, batch processing
- **Error Handling**: Rich error hierarchy, circuit breaker pattern
- **Configuration**: Pydantic validators, baseline tracking
- **Orchestration**: Coordinator pattern with context propagation

### Developing Components (Needs Enhancement)
- **Monitoring**: Guards and health checks exist, no centralization
- **Logging**: Multiple systems, needs unification
- **Strategy Tools**: Filters and guards exist, need composition
- **Performance**: Infrastructure exists, underutilized

### Critical Gaps
| Gap | Priority | Effort | Impact |
|-----|----------|--------|--------|
| Distributed tracing | HIGH | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| Metrics aggregation | HIGH | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| Dependency injection | MEDIUM | HIGH | MEDIUM |
| Validation rules library | MEDIUM | LOW | MEDIUM |
| Unified logging | MEDIUM | LOW | MEDIUM |
| Bulkhead pattern | LOW | MEDIUM | LOW |
