## Exception Process

To add a new approved abbreviation:

1. Open a PR with the proposed addition to this glossary
2. Include rationale for why the abbreviation improves clarity
3. Require maintainer approval
4. If the abbreviation was previously banned, update `scripts/agents/naming_inventory.py`

## Inline Exceptions

For legacy code or external API compatibility, use `# naming: allow` comments:

```python
# External API field - cannot rename
response_qty = api_response["qty"]  # naming: allow
```

## Enforcement

Naming standards are enforced via:
- **Pre-commit hook**: Blocks commits with violations (use `SKIP=naming-check git commit` to bypass)
- **CI check**: Generates reports uploaded as artifacts
- **Code review**: Reviewers flag deviations

See `docs/naming.md` for complete naming conventions.
