# Paper Trade Dashboard Refactor – Phase 2 Complete

**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Pattern:** Extract → Test → Integrate → Validate

## What Changed

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Metrics calculation | Inline in `PaperTradingDashboard` (47 lines) | `dashboard/metrics.py` (`DashboardMetricsAssembler`) |
| Dashboard façade size | `main.py` 401 → 354 lines | −47 lines (12% reduction) |
| Tests | 51 (after Phase 1) | 57 (+6 metrics tests) |

### Highlights
- Created `DashboardMetricsAssembler` to compute equity, returns, drawdown, win-rate, and exposure.
- `PaperTradingDashboard.calculate_metrics()` delegates to the assembler, keeping public API unchanged.
- Added `tests/unit/bot_v2/features/paper_trade/dashboard/test_metrics.py` to cover returns, exposure, zero-equity, and no-trade scenarios.
- Package `__init__.py` now re-exports formatter and metrics helpers for reuse.

## Test Coverage
- `pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/features/paper_trade` → **375 tests** (all green).
  - +6 formatter tests from Phase 1
  - +6 metrics tests added in this phase

## Notes
- Legacy drawdown behaviour (using current equity as peak proxy) preserved to avoid regressions.
- Wrapper methods (`format_currency`, `format_pct`, `calculate_metrics`) remain for existing tests.
- Metrics assembler can be reused by HTML exporter or other Surfaces in Phase 3+.

## Next Steps
Phase 3 will extract the console rendering functions (header, summary, positions, performance, trades) into a dedicated renderer module, enabling further reductions in `main.py` and clearer responsibilities.
