description: Default ensemble configuration with confidence leader voting

# Voting mechanism
voting_method: confidence_leader  # Follow highest-confidence strategy on conflict

# Base strategy weights (before regime adjustment)
# These sum to ~1.0 and represent default allocation
base_weights:
  baseline: 0.4
  mean_reversion: 0.4

# Regime-specific weight adjustments (multipliers)
# Values > 1.0 increase weight, < 1.0 decrease weight
regime_weight_adjustments:
  BULL_QUIET:
    baseline: 0.8      # Reduce trend-following in quiet markets
    mean_reversion: 1.5  # Mean reversion works well in quiet uptrends

  BULL_VOLATILE:
    baseline: 1.2      # Trend-following better in volatile uptrends
    mean_reversion: 0.6  # Mean reversion riskier in volatile markets

  BEAR_QUIET:
    baseline: 0.6      # Reduce exposure in bear markets
    mean_reversion: 1.3  # Mean reversion can catch bounces

  BEAR_VOLATILE:
    baseline: 0.4      # Significantly reduce in volatile bear
    mean_reversion: 0.4  # Both strategies cautious

  SIDEWAYS_QUIET:
    baseline: 0.5      # Trend signals less reliable sideways
    mean_reversion: 1.8  # Mean reversion ideal for ranging

  SIDEWAYS_VOLATILE:
    baseline: 0.7      # Some trend signals on breakouts
    mean_reversion: 1.0  # Moderate mean reversion

  CRISIS:
    baseline: 0.2      # Minimal exposure in crisis
    mean_reversion: 0.2  # Minimal exposure in crisis

# Confidence requirements
min_ensemble_confidence: 0.4  # Below this, output HOLD

# Crisis behavior
crisis_behavior: scaled_down  # Options: scaled_down, reduce_only, halt
crisis_scale_factor: 0.2      # Scale position sizes to 20% in crisis
