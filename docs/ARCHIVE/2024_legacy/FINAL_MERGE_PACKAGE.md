## 📋 Quick Reference

### Merge Commands
```bash
# Run merge checklist
./scripts/merge_checklist_v2.1.0.sh

# Tag and release
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Type consolidation and performance optimizations"
git push origin v2.1.0

# Create GitHub release
gh release create v2.1.0 \
  --title "v2.1.0 - Performance & Type Consolidation" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v2.1.0.md

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feat/qol-progress-logging
git push origin main
```

### Post-Merge Monitoring
```bash
# Single check
python scripts/post_merge_monitor.py --once

# Continuous monitoring (24 hours)
python scripts/post_merge_monitor.py --continuous 24

# Manual smoke tests
python -m src.bot_v2.simple_cli broker --broker coinbase --sandbox
python scripts/validate_critical_fixes.py
```

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Feature flags (no code change)
export COINBASE_ENABLE_KEEP_ALIVE=0
export COINBASE_JITTER_FACTOR=0

# Code rollback
git revert HEAD~2  # Revert both PRs
```
