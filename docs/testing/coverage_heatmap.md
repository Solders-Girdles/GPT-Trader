## Testing Backlog (Priority Order)

Based on coverage gaps and module criticality:

1. **core** - 25.0% (2 modules below 70%)

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (This Sprint)

2. **Establish Baseline Tests**
   - Each module should have at least 70% coverage
   - Focus on happy path + error handling

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Build scenario tests for broker/orchestration interactions
   - Use recorded Coinbase fixtures for deterministic tests

### Phase 1 Goals

- [ ] Bring all feature slices to â‰¥80% coverage
- [ ] Add integration tests for orchestration layer
- [ ] Establish coverage gates in CI (fail if coverage drops)

### Phase 2 Goals

- [ ] Achieve â‰¥90% coverage across all features
- [ ] Add property-based tests for critical calculations (risk, fees)
- [ ] Build comprehensive scenario test suite
