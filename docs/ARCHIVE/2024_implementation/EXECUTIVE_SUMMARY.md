## Security Configuration

### Key Management
```
Trading Keys:
- Name: perps-demo-trading-write-202508
- Scopes: orders, positions, products, fills
- Type: JWT (CDP API)

Monitor Keys:
- Name: perps-demo-monitor-read-202508
- Scopes: read-only analytics
- Type: Separate credential
```

### IP Allowlist
- Production: Fixed egress IPs configured
- Demo: Allowlist enabled with rotation SOP
- Documentation: `/docs/ops/SECURITY/ip_allowlist.md`

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Demo Trading (Immediate)
1. Deploy with minimal notional (0.0001 BTC)
2. Post-only limits initially
3. Single symbol focus (BTC-PERP)
4. Monitor acceptance rates
5. Validate funding calculations

### Phase 3: Canary Production (After Demo)
1. Real funds with tiny sizes
2. Gradual symbol expansion
3. Performance metrics collection
4. PnL tracking and validation
5. Risk limit verification

## Critical Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Latency: < 200ms p50 ✅
- Order Success: > 95% acceptance
- WebSocket Uptime: > 99.9%
- Error Recovery: < 30s
- Position Sync: Real-time

### Safety Thresholds
- Max Position: 1% of portfolio
- Max Daily Loss: 2% auto-stop
- Max Order Impact: 15 bps
- Min Liquidity: $100k depth
- Funding Cap: 0.1% daily

## Risk Mitigation

### Operational Safeguards
1. Gradual rollout with checkpoints
2. Manual approval for size increases  
3. Automated monitoring and alerts
4. Daily reconciliation processes
5. Emergency shutdown procedures

### Technical Safeguards
1. Order validation before submission
2. Position limit enforcement
3. Duplicate order prevention
4. Stale price detection
5. Connection health monitoring
