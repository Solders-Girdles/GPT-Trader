      - "Docker deployment viable"
      - "Paper trading enabled"
      - "Production deployment meaningful"

# Current Work Status

# Decision Log
decisions:
  - date: "2025-08-19"
    decision: "Pause EPIC-003 to create EPIC-002.5"
    rationale: "Discovered slices not integrated, orchestration critical"
    impact: "2-week delay but enables all future work"
    approved_by: "System architect review"

# Success Criteria
success_metrics:
  epic_002_5:
    must_have:
      - "Can run: python -m bot_v2 --mode backtest"
      - "All 11 slices connected"
      - "Docker container runs"
      - "Basic workflows execute"
    
    nice_to_have:
      - "WebSocket API"
      - "Advanced workflows"
      - "Performance < 100ms"
      - "Hot reload support"

# Notes
notes:
  - "Critical discovery: Sprint 2 unified pipeline was never built"
  - "All slices work independently but cannot work together"
  - "Orchestration is the keystone that makes everything valuable"
  - "Without orchestration, we're building parts that can't be assembled"
  - "This should have been discovered earlier in EPIC-002"
  - "Better to fix now than continue building on sand"
