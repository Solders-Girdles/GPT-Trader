## 🔍 Critical Discoveries

### ML Pipeline Status
**CRITICAL FINDING**: ML components are 95% complete but entirely blocked by missing 'schedule' dependency

**What Exists**:
- Sophisticated ML infrastructure (674-line production orchestrator!)
- Feature engineering pipeline
- Auto-retraining system
- Model versioning and lifecycle management
- XGBoost strategy selection
- Deep learning and RL implementations

**Single Blocker**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'schedule'`

### Vulnerability Assessment

| Type | Severity | Location | Fix Required |
|------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Missing dependency | CRITICAL | pyproject.toml | Add `schedule = "^1.2.0"` |
| Input validation | HIGH | Strategy parameters | Add bounds checking |
| SQL injection | HIGH | strategy_collection.py | Use parameterized queries |
| Memory limits | MEDIUM | DataPipeline | Add size validation |
| Thread safety | MEDIUM | Orchestrator | Add locking mechanisms |
