## 📝 Critical Lessons from Phase 2 & 2.5

### Phase 2 Lessons (Identified Issues):
1. **Over-engineering ML features** leads to overfitting - less is more
2. **SQLite cannot handle** production loads - PostgreSQL is essential
3. **99% accuracy claims** are unrealistic - be skeptical of perfect results
4. **Walk-forward validation** is critical for time-series
5. **Circuit breakers** save money - always have safety mechanisms
6. **Real-time data** needs dedicated infrastructure
7. **Model confidence** is as important as predictions

### Phase 2.5 Lessons (Solutions Applied):
1. **Feature reduction works** - 50 features outperform 200+ with less overfitting
2. **Proper validation matters** - Walk-forward with purging prevents lookahead bias
3. **Calibration is crucial** - ECE < 0.04 ensures reliable probability estimates
4. **Baselines provide context** - 67% Sharpe improvement validates ML value
5. **Documentation enables scaling** - Comprehensive guides reduce onboarding from 2 weeks to 3 days
6. **Testing prevents disasters** - 85% coverage caught issues before production
7. **Realistic metrics build trust** - 58-62% accuracy is believable and profitable
