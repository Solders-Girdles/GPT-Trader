# 🎯 Week 3: Market Regime Detection Implementation Plan

## 📊 Overview

**Goal**: Build a market regime detection system that classifies market conditions in real-time, enabling smarter strategy selection and risk management.

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### New Feature Slice: `features/market_regime/`

**Complete isolation maintained** - No dependencies on other slices
**Token efficiency**: Target ~500 tokens for entire slice

## 📋 Implementation Components

### 1. **Regime Types to Detect**

```python
class MarketRegime:
    # Primary Regimes
    - BULL_QUIET      # Steady uptrend, low volatility
    - BULL_VOLATILE   # Uptrend with high volatility
    - BEAR_QUIET      # Steady downtrend, low volatility  
    - BEAR_VOLATILE   # Downtrend with high volatility
    - SIDEWAYS_QUIET  # Range-bound, low volatility
    - SIDEWAYS_VOLATILE # Range-bound, high volatility
    
    # Risk Regimes
    - RISK_ON         # Market favoring risk assets
    - RISK_OFF        # Flight to safety
    - CRISIS          # Extreme volatility/drawdown
```

### 2. **Detection Methods**

**A. Volatility Regime Detection**
```python
def detect_volatility_regime(data: pd.DataFrame) -> VolatilityRegime:
    """
    Methods:
    - GARCH modeling for volatility clustering
    - Rolling standard deviation analysis
    - VIX correlation (if available)
    - Bollinger Band width analysis
    """
```

**B. Trend Regime Detection**
```python
def detect_trend_regime(data: pd.DataFrame) -> TrendRegime:
    """
    Methods:
    - Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
    - Moving average alignment
    - ADX (Average Directional Index)
    - Linear regression channels
    """
```

**C. Risk Sentiment Detection**
```python
def detect_risk_sentiment(data: pd.DataFrame) -> RiskSentiment:
    """
    Indicators:
    - Safe haven flows (bonds, gold, USD)
    - Sector rotation patterns
    - Correlation breakdowns
    - Volume/volatility relationships
    """
```

### 3. **Core Modules**

**market_regime.py** (Main orchestration)
```python
def detect_regime(
    symbol: str,
    lookback_days: int = 60
) -> RegimeAnalysis:
    """
    Main entry point for regime detection.
    Returns comprehensive regime analysis.
    """

def monitor_regime_changes(
    symbols: List[str],
    callback: Callable
) -> RegimeMonitor:
    """
    Real-time regime monitoring with alerts.
    """
```

**models.py** (Regime classification models)
```python
class HMMRegimeDetector:
    """Hidden Markov Model for regime detection"""
    
class GARCHVolatilityModel:
    """GARCH model for volatility regimes"""
    
class RegimeEnsemble:
    """Ensemble of multiple regime detectors"""
```

**features.py** (Feature engineering)
```python
def calculate_regime_features(data: pd.DataFrame) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Features:
    - Volatility metrics (realized, GARCH, implied)
    - Trend indicators (MA alignment, momentum)
    - Market microstructure (volume, spreads)
    - Cross-asset signals (bonds, commodities)
    """
```

**transitions.py** (Regime transition analysis)
```python
def calculate_transition_matrix() -> np.ndarray:
    """Historical regime transition probabilities"""
    
def predict_regime_change(
    current_regime: MarketRegime,
    features: np.ndarray
) -> RegimeChangePrediction:
    """Predict probability of regime change"""
```

### 4. **Integration Points**

**With ML Strategy Selection**:
```python
# Enhanced strategy selection using regime
def predict_best_strategy_with_regime(
    symbol: str,
    regime: MarketRegime
) -> StrategyPrediction:
    """
    Different strategies for different regimes:
    - BULL_QUIET → Momentum strategies
    - BEAR_VOLATILE → Risk management focus
    - SIDEWAYS_QUIET → Mean reversion
    """
```

**With Risk Management**:
```python
# Adjust risk based on regime
def get_regime_risk_multiplier(regime: MarketRegime) -> float:
    """
    Risk adjustments:
    - CRISIS → 0.2x position size
    - BEAR_VOLATILE → 0.5x position size
    - BULL_QUIET → 1.2x position size
    """
```
