# Phase 0 Review Request - PerpsBot Refactoring Safety Net

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Ready for Team Review
**Reviewers Needed**: 1-2 engineers familiar with PerpsBot

## What Needs Review

We've completed Phase 0 of the PerpsBot refactoring - establishing a safety net before any code changes. We need a quick peer review of:

1. **Dependency Documentation** - Are we missing any critical dependencies or side effects?
2. **Characterization Tests** - Do these cover the right behaviors?
3. **Open Questions Answers** - Do our conclusions make sense?

## Review Artifacts

### Primary Documents

1. **üìã Dependency Map**: `docs/architecture/perps_bot_dependencies.md`
   - Complete initialization sequence
   - All side effects documented
   - MarketDataService extraction checklist
   - Answered open questions

2. **‚úÖ Characterization Tests**: `tests/integration/test_perps_bot_characterization.py`
   - 18 passed, 3 skipped
   - Covers initialization, update_marks, properties, delegation, thread safety
   - TODOs for team expansion

3. **üìä Status Document**: `docs/architecture/REFACTORING_PHASE_0_STATUS.md`
   - Progress tracking
   - Key discoveries
   - Lessons learned

### Supporting Materials

4. **üêõ Bug Report**: `docs/issues/ISSUE_product_map_dead_code.md`
   - _product_map dead code discovered
   - Needs decision before Phase 1

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. Dependency Documentation Review (~15 min)

**File**: `docs/architecture/perps_bot_dependencies.md`

**Questions**:
- [ ] Are all critical dependencies listed in the init sequence?
- [ ] Are we missing any side effects in `update_marks()`?
- [ ] Do the open question answers make sense?
- [ ] Is the MarketDataService extraction checklist complete?

**Pay Special Attention To**:
- Lines 65-118: MarketDataService side effects checklist
- Lines 128-140: Streaming lock sharing requirements
- Lines 272-311: Open questions answers

### 2. Characterization Tests Review (~10 min)

**File**: `tests/integration/test_perps_bot_characterization.py`

**Questions**:
- [ ] Do tests document the RIGHT behaviors?
- [ ] Are we testing implementation or behavior?
- [ ] Any critical paths missing?
- [ ] Test names clear and descriptive?

**Run Tests**:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_perps_bot_characterization.py -v -m characterization
# Should see: 18 passed, 3 skipped
```

**Pay Special Attention To**:
- Lines 117-127: Lock type checking (discovered _thread.RLock)
- Lines 250-276: Property error handling (discovered frozen registry)
- Lines 356-386: Thread safety verification

### 3. Key Discoveries Validation (~5 min)

**File**: `docs/architecture/REFACTORING_PHASE_0_STATUS.md`

**Questions**:
- [ ] Do the "Key Discoveries" align with your understanding?
- [ ] Is the _product_map bug actually a bug?
- [ ] Are we missing any PerpsBot quirks you know about?

**Key Claims to Verify**:
1. ServiceRegistry is frozen dataclass ‚úÖ
2. _mark_lock is _thread.RLock (not threading.RLock) ‚úÖ
3. _product_map is never written to ‚úÖ
4. update_marks doesn't write to event_store ‚úÖ
5. Only streaming uses event_store ‚úÖ

## How to Review

### Option A: Quick Review (30 minutes)

1. **Skim dependency doc** - Check init sequence + side effects
2. **Run characterization tests** - Verify they pass
3. **Read "Open Questions Answers"** - Spot-check a few
4. **Leave feedback** - Comment on this document or in Slack

### Option B: Deep Review (1 hour)

1. **Read dependency doc thoroughly**
2. **Read all characterization tests**
3. **Run tests and inspect code coverage**
4. **Compare against actual PerpsBot behavior**
5. **Add TODO assertions** (see contribution guide below)
6. **Document findings in review comments**

## Feedback Format

Please provide feedback as:

```markdown
## Review Feedback - [Your Name]

**Dependency Doc**:
- ‚úÖ Looks good / ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue found: [description]
- Missing: [anything we missed]
- Question: [clarifications needed]

**Characterization Tests**:
- ‚úÖ Coverage looks sufficient / ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing: [critical paths]
- Suggestion: [additional tests needed]

**Open Questions Answers**:
- ‚úÖ Agree with conclusions / ‚ùå Disagree: [which ones and why]

**Overall**:
- [ ] Approve Phase 0 for completion
- [ ] Needs changes before Phase 1
```

## Review Checklist

### For Reviewers

- [ ] Read dependency doc initialization sequence
- [ ] Verify side effects checklist is complete
- [ ] Run characterization tests (all passing?)
- [ ] Review open questions answers
- [ ] Check for missing PerpsBot behaviors
- [ ] Verify _product_map bug is accurate
- [ ] Consider phase 1 impact
- [ ] Leave structured feedback

### For Phase 0 Completion

After review, we need:
- [ ] At least 1 approval from engineer familiar with PerpsBot
- [ ] All feedback addressed or documented as "won't fix"
- [ ] _product_map bug decision made (fix or remove)
- [ ] Team has expanded characterization tests (optional but encouraged)

## What Happens After Review

### If Approved ‚úÖ
1. Mark Phase 0 as complete
2. Resolve _product_map bug
3. Proceed to Phase 1 (MarketDataService extraction)
4. Use characterization tests as regression suite

### If Changes Needed ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Address feedback
2. Update docs/tests
3. Request re-review
4. Iterate until approved

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to understand the whole refactoring plan?
**A**: No - just review the Phase 0 artifacts for accuracy. The refactoring plan is separate.

### Q: What if I find something we missed?
**A**: Great! Add a TODO to the characterization tests or update the dependency doc. That's the point of review.

### Q: Should tests be testing behavior or implementation?
**A**: Behavior. We want to freeze "what happens", not "how it's coded". Implementation will change in refactor.

### Q: How long should this review take?
**A**: 30 minutes for quick review, 1 hour for thorough review.

### Q: What if I disagree with an open question answer?
**A**: Flag it in feedback! We can re-investigate before proceeding.
