## Running Coverage Reports

### Quick Terminal Report
```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Full HTML Report
```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html:htmlcov --cov-report=term-missing
# Open htmlcov/index.html in browser
```

### Developer Script
```bash
./scripts/run_coverage_report.py
```

### CI Coverage Check
```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=json:coverage.json --cov-fail-under=72.87
```

## Coverage Configuration

Coverage settings are configured in `pytest.ini`:

```ini
# Coverage configuration (when using --cov)
# Run with: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=json:coverage.json --cov-report=html:htmlcov
# Current baseline: 72.87% (as of 2025-10-19)
# Short-term goal: 80%
# Long-term goal: 90%
```

## Contributing to Coverage

When adding new code:

1. **Write tests first** - Aim for 80%+ coverage on new features
2. **Test edge cases** - Include error conditions and boundary values
3. **Use property-based testing** - For complex business logic
4. **Run coverage locally** - Use `./scripts/run_coverage_report.py`
5. **Update this document** - When coverage changes significantly

## Coverage Exclusions

The following are intentionally excluded from coverage:

- Test files themselves (`tests/`)
- Documentation and examples (`docs/`, `scripts/`)
- Third-party code and generated files
- Abstract base classes with no implementation
- Defensive error handling for truly unreachable code paths

## Troubleshooting

### Coverage Not Updating
- Clear pytest cache: `poetry run pytest --cache-clear`
- Remove old coverage files: `rm -rf .coverage coverage.xml htmlcov/`

### Inconsistent Results
- Ensure all tests run: `poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing -x`
- Check for import issues or skipped tests

### CI Failures
- Coverage regression detected - review recent changes
- Check `coverage.json` for detailed breakdown
- Use HTML report to identify uncovered lines
