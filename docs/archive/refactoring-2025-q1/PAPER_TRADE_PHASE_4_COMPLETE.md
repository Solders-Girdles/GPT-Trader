# Paper Trade Refactor – Phase 4 Complete

**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Pattern:** Extract → Test → Integrate → Validate

## Goal

Extract performance tracking and result building logic from `paper_trade.py` to dedicated modules
so equity history, metrics calculation, and result assembly are testable in isolation.

## Key Changes

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `paper_trade.py` | `_calculate_metrics`, `_build_result`, manual history list | Delegates to `PerformanceTracker`, `PerformanceCalculator`, `ResultBuilder` |
| New modules | — | `performance.py` (209 lines) |
| Tests | — | `tests/unit/bot_v2/features/paper_trade/test_performance.py` (12 tests) |

### Responsibilities Extracted
- **PerformanceTracker** – records equity snapshots, maintains legacy-compatible history, exposes
  pandas Series builder.
- **PerformanceCalculator** – computes total return, daily return, Sharpe, drawdown, win rate,
  profit factor; identical formulas to legacy implementation.
- **ResultBuilder** – produces `PaperTradeResult` and `TradingSessionResult`, wiring in metrics and
  equity curves.

### Compatibility
- `PaperTradingSession.equity_history` remains available (property backed by tracker, setter keeps
  legacy tests working).
- `_calculate_metrics()` retained as thin wrapper for existing unit tests.
- `get_results()` / `get_trading_session()` behaviour unchanged.

## Test Coverage

| Suite | Tests |
|-------|-------|
| Session config (Phase 1) | 19 |
| Trading loop (Phase 2) | 17 |
| Strategy runner (Phase 3) | 15 |
| **Performance tracker (Phase 4)** | **12** |
| Baseline (legacy) | 302 |
| **Total** | **365** |

(All tests passing: `pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/features/paper_trade`.)

## Metrics Impact

- `paper_trade.py`: 331 → 260 lines (-71)
- `performance.py`: 209 focused lines
- New tests ensure metrics edge-cases (zero variance, drawdown, win/loss ratios) are validated.

## Next Steps

Phase 5 will wrap the façade cleanup and module-level helpers, finalizing the slice with a
≤220-line orchestrator.
