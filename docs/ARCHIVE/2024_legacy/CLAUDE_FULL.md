```

### 🧠 Intelligence Components (Path B: Smart Money)

**Week 1-2: ML Strategy Selection ✅ COMPLETE**
- Dynamic strategy switching based on conditions
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- 35% return improvement in backtesting

**Week 3: Market Regime Detection ✅ COMPLETE**  
- 7 regime types (Bull/Bear/Sideways × Quiet/Volatile + Crisis)
- Real-time monitoring with transition prediction
- Regime-aware strategy recommendations

**Week 4: Intelligent Position Sizing ✅ COMPLETE**
- Kelly Criterion implementation
- Confidence-based allocation
- Regime-adjusted sizing

**Week 5: Adaptive Portfolio Management ✅ COMPLETE (NEW!)**
- Configuration-first design for rapid strategy adaptation
- Tier-based portfolio management ($500 to $50,000+)
- Clean data provider abstraction pattern
- Automatic risk and position scaling

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Complete Isolation with Clean Abstractions
- **Each slice is self-contained** (~500-600 tokens to load)
- **No shared dependencies** between slices
- **Clean import patterns** - no ugly try/except blocks
- **Data provider abstraction** - consistent API across slices
- **Configuration-first design** - behavior controlled by JSON files

### Vertical Slice Organization
```
Task: "Run backtest" → Load ONLY features/backtest/ 
Task: "Detect regime" → Load ONLY features/market_regime/
Task: "ML strategy selection" → Load ONLY features/ml_strategy/
Task: "Adaptive portfolio" → Load ONLY features/adaptive_portfolio/
```

### Clean Data Provider Pattern (NEW!)
```python
# All slices use consistent interface
from src.bot_v2.data_providers import get_data_provider

provider = get_data_provider()  # Auto-detects available libraries
data = provider.get_historical_data("AAPL", period="60d")
```

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Test specific slice
python -m pytest tests/integration/bot_v2/test_backtester.py

# Run ML strategy selection
python -c "from src.bot_v2.features.ml_strategy import predict_best_strategy; print(predict_best_strategy('AAPL'))"

# Detect market regime
python -c "from src.bot_v2.features.market_regime import detect_regime; print(detect_regime('AAPL'))"

# Adaptive portfolio analysis
python -c "from src.bot_v2.features.adaptive_portfolio import run_adaptive_strategy; print(run_adaptive_strategy(5000))"
```

## 🛡️ Organizational Improvements

### **Root Directory Cleanup (NEW!)**
- **24+ debug files archived** to `archived/root_debug_files_20250817/`
- **3 root Python files moved** to appropriate locations
- **Configuration externalized** to `config/` directory
- **Clean separation** between code and data storage

### **Test Structure Improvement**
- **Proper test organization**: `tests/integration/bot_v2/`
- **Slice-specific tests**: Each feature has dedicated test files
- **Integration tests**: Full system validation
- **Standalone tests**: Independent verification

### **Data Provider Abstraction (NEW!)**
```python
# Clean pattern eliminates ugly try/except blocks
class DataProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_historical_data(self, symbol: str, period: str = "60d") -> DataFrame:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_current_price(self, symbol: str) -> float:
        pass

# Implementations handle specific libraries
class YFinanceProvider(DataProvider): ...
class AlpacaProvider(DataProvider): ...
class MockProvider(DataProvider): ...  # For testing
```

## ⚠️ Knowledge Layer Warnings

**CURRENT DOCS (Use These):**
- `CLAUDE.md` (this file) - Current V2 control center
- `.knowledge/` - Authoritative agent knowledge
- `src/bot_v2/SLICES.md` - Agent navigation guide
- `src/bot_v2/README.md` - Current architecture overview
- `README.md` - Updated V2 system description

## 🔄 Session Continuity Protocols

### Starting a New Session: Context Recovery
1. **Check Current Progress**: Read the todo list (always displayed at session start)
2. **Check Project State**: Review `.knowledge/STATE.json` and `src/bot_v2/SLICES.md`
3. **Identify Active Work**: Review `context/active_epics.yaml` and recent commits
4. **Dive In**: Open the relevant slice documentation under `src/bot_v2/features/`

### Multi-Session Task Management
```bash
# Essential reads for context recovery:
1. Todo list (system provides automatically)
2. .knowledge/STATE.json (latest system snapshot)
3. src/bot_v2/SLICES.md (current architecture)
4. This CLAUDE.md file (system status)
```

### Detecting Continuation Scenarios
- "Continue with Week X" → Check `.knowledge/STATE.json` and `context/active_epics.yaml`
- "Fix the issue we discussed" → Check recent project files and commit history
- "Where were we?" → Review in_progress todos and recent completion dates

## 📚 Knowledge Layer Usage Guide

### Essential Navigation Files 
- **`.knowledge/START_HERE.md`**: Begin every session here
- **`.knowledge/AGENTS.md`**: Complete agent directory and delegation
- **`.knowledge/ORGANIZATION.md`**: How we're organized
- **`.knowledge/DELEGATION_WORKFLOWS.md`**: Standard workflows
- **`.knowledge/WHERE_TO_PUT.md`**: File placement guide
- **`.knowledge/RULES.md`**: Critical architectural constraints  
- **`.knowledge/STATE.json`**: Current system status

### When to Check `.knowledge/`

3rd: .knowledge/AGENTS.md (who can help)
4th: .knowledge/DELEGATION_WORKFLOWS.md (how to work)
5th: src/bot_v2/SLICES.md (architecture navigation)
6th: Project files for actual work
```

## 🎯 Complex Task Management Protocols

### Agent Delegation Decision Matrix
```
Use Task tool when:
✅ Task requires >500 tokens of context
✅ Specialized expertise needed (architecture, ML, testing)
✅ Multi-file changes across different areas
✅ Template exists in TASK_TEMPLATES.md

Handle directly when:
❌ Simple edits to current files
❌ Reading and analysis tasks
❌ Todo list management
❌ Navigation and status checks
```

### Agent Workflow Best Practices (NEW!)
```
Organizational Analysis → @repo-structure-guardian
Architectural Decisions → @tech-lead-orchestrator  
Implementation Work → @backend-developer
Quality Assurance → @code-reviewer
Documentation → @documentation-specialist
```

## 🏢 Workforce Organization

Current: Using Claude Code built-in agents plus a small pilot set of custom specialists defined in `.claude/agents/`. See `.claude/agents/agent_mapping.yaml` for role mapping.

- Agent availability and counts are tracked in `.knowledge/STATE.json`.
- See `.knowledge/AGENTS.md` for roles and delegation patterns.
- Custom specialized workforce is being reintroduced incrementally.

## 🤖 Agent Flows (Claude Code)

These prompts orchestrate common multi-step tasks using our built-ins and pilot custom agents. Use in Claude Code chat; keep file paths limited to the target slice.

Strategy Change Pipeline (slice-scoped)
