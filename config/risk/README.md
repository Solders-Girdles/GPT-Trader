Legacy Risk Templates (Moved)

The reference risk templates have moved to:
- docs/reference/risk_templates/

The runtime does not load templates from this directory. Active risk settings
come from profile YAML (config/profiles/*.yaml) plus env overrides (RISK_*).
Use the templates in docs/reference/risk_templates/ for manual wiring or
documentation-only reference.
