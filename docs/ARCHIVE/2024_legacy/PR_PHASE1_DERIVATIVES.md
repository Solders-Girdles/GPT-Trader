# PR: Phase 1 - Derivatives API Enablement

## Summary
Enables core derivatives capabilities in the Coinbase integration with clean routing, adapter wiring, and mode-aware gating. This is the foundation for perpetual futures trading support.

## Scope
Phase 1 focuses on basic derivatives infrastructure without trading logic:
- CFM endpoint routing and mode gating
- Adapter wiring for derivatives operations
- Test coverage and validation

## Files Modified

### Implementation
- `src/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/adapter.py`
  - Added `close_position()` method with proper payload construction
  - Already had `list_positions()` using CFM endpoints when derivatives enabled
  - Already had `reduce_only` and `leverage` support in `place_order()`

### Tests (New)
- `tests/unit/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/test_derivatives_phase1.py`
  - 19 comprehensive tests covering:
    - CFM method routing in advanced mode
    - Exchange mode gating (blocking)
    - Adapter derivatives operations
    - No hardcoded paths verification

### Validation (New)
- `scripts/validate_derivatives_phase1.py`
  - Quick validation script for CI/CD
  - Tests routing, gating, and adapter smoke tests

### Documentation
- `docs/COINBASE_README.md`
  - Added "Derivatives Prerequisites" section
  - Listed Phase 1 enabled features
  - Clear requirements for derivatives access

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

### 1. No Hardcoded Paths
```bash
$ rg -n '"/api/v3/brokerage"' src/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/client.py | grep -E "(cfm_|close_position)"
# No output - ‚úÖ No hardcoded paths found
```

### 2. All Methods Use _get_endpoint_path
```bash
$ rg -n "_get_endpoint_path\('(cfm_|close_position)" src/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/client.py
591:        path = self._get_endpoint_path('close_position')
713:        path = self._get_endpoint_path('cfm_balance_summary')
722:        path = self._get_endpoint_path('cfm_positions')
731:        path = self._get_endpoint_path('cfm_position', product_id=product_id)
# ‚úÖ All derivatives methods use proper routing
```

### 3. Exchange Mode Gating
```bash
$ rg -n "not available in exchange mode" src/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/client.py | grep -B2 cfm_
# All CFM methods have proper gating - ‚úÖ
```

### 4. Tests Pass
```bash
$ pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/test_derivatives_phase1.py -v
======================== 19 passed, 2 warnings in 0.45s ========================
```

### 5. Validation Script
```bash
$ python scripts/validate_derivatives_phase1.py
============================================================
Phase 1 - Derivatives API Enablement Validation
============================================================
  ‚úÖ Advanced mode routing: PASSED
  ‚úÖ Exchange mode gating: PASSED
  ‚úÖ Adapter smoke test: PASSED
üéâ ALL TESTS PASSED - Phase 1 Complete!
```

## Key Features Enabled

### Client Methods (Already Existed with Proper Gating)
- `cfm_balance_summary()` - Get balance summary
- `cfm_positions()` - List all CFM positions
- `cfm_position(product_id)` - Get specific position
- `cfm_intraday_current_margin_window()` - Get margin window
- `cfm_intraday_margin_setting(payload)` - Set margin parameters
- `close_position(payload)` - Close derivatives position

### Adapter Methods
- `list_positions()` - Uses CFM endpoints when derivatives enabled
- `place_order()` - Supports `reduce_only` and `leverage` parameters
- `close_position(symbol, qty, reduce_only)` - NEW: Close position with optional partial qty

## Configuration Required
```bash
# Environment variables
COINBASE_ENABLE_DERIVATIVES=1      # Enable derivatives features
COINBASE_API_MODE=advanced         # Must use advanced mode
```

## Not in Scope (Future Phases)
- Product catalog updates (Phase 2)
- WebSocket streaming for perps (Phase 3)
- PnL/funding accrual (Phase 4)
- Risk/strategy logic (Phase 5-6)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Run unit tests:**
```bash
pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/test_derivatives_phase1.py -v
```

2. **Run validation script:**
```bash
python scripts/validate_derivatives_phase1.py
```

3. **Verify no hardcoded paths:**
```bash
rg -n '"/api/v3' src/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/client.py
```

4. **Check mode gating:**
```bash
# Should see InvalidRequestError for all CFM methods
grep -A3 "def cfm_" src/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/client.py
```

## Notes
- All CFM methods were already implemented in `client.py` with proper routing and gating
- Only needed to add `close_position()` to the adapter
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures no regression
- Exchange mode properly blocks all derivatives features with clear error messages
