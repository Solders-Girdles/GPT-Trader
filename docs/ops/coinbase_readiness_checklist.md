# Coinbase API Alignment Readiness Checklist

**Purpose:** Pre-flight validation for live Coinbase integration (Sandbox → Production)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** Ready for execution

---

## Overview

This checklist ensures GPT-Trader's implementation aligns with Coinbase API requirements, rate limits, permissions, and operational best practices before live trading deployment.

---

## 1. API Credentials & Permissions

**Sandbox Environment:**
- [ ] Coinbase Sandbox API credentials configured in `.env`
  ```bash
  COINBASE_API_KEY=organizations/{org_id}/apiKeys/{key_id}
  COINBASE_API_SECRET=<base64-encoded-private-key>
  ```
- [ ] Verify API key permissions match requirements:
  - [ ] `wallet:accounts:read` - Account snapshot, balances
  - [ ] `wallet:trades:create` - Order execution
  - [ ] `wallet:trades:read` - Order status, fills
  - [ ] `wallet:user:read` - Fee tiers, trading limits
  - [ ] `wallet:payment-methods:read` - Funding methods (optional)

**Production Environment:**
- [ ] Production API credentials obtained and secured
- [ ] Verify fee tier matches assumptions in risk config
  - Current assumption: Maker 0.40%, Taker 0.60% (Tier 1)
  - [ ] Run: `poetry run perps-bot --account-snapshot` to confirm actual tier
- [ ] Verify trading limits (daily, monthly) match bot configuration
- [ ] Confirm INTX access if perpetuals are required (check: `COINBASE_ENABLE_DERIVATIVES=1`)

---

## 2. Rate Limit Handling

**REST API Rate Limits (Coinbase Advanced Trade):**
- Public endpoints: 10 requests/second
- Private endpoints: 15 requests/second
- Order placement: 10 requests/second

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Review `src/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/rest_client.py` for rate limit handling
  - [ ] Verify `rate_limiter` implementation uses token bucket algorithm
  - [ ] Confirm backoff strategy on 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
  - [ ] Check retry logic: exponential backoff with jitter
- [ ] Test rate limit behavior in sandbox:
  ```bash
  # Trigger rate limit intentionally
  poetry run pytest tests/integration/brokerages/test_coinbase_rate_limits.py -v
  ```
- [ ] Validate rate limit metrics exported to Prometheus:
  - [ ] `gpt_trader_rate_limit_hits_total` - Counter for 429 responses
  - [ ] `gpt_trader_rate_limit_backoff_seconds` - Histogram of backoff durations

**WebSocket Rate Limits:**
- Connection limit: 100 simultaneous connections
- Message rate: 750 messages/second (aggregate)

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Review `src/bot_v2/features/market_data/streaming_service.py` for WebSocket limits
- [ ] Verify subscription throttling (batched subscribe requests)
- [ ] Test reconnection logic doesn't exceed connection limits

---

## 3. REST API Endpoint Coverage

**Order Management (Critical Path):**
- [ ] `POST /api/v3/brokerage/orders` - Create order
  - [ ] Spot orders tested: `test_coinbase_spot_order_creation.py`
  - [ ] Perpetual orders tested (if INTX): `test_coinbase_perp_order_creation.py`
  - [ ] Validate client_order_id uniqueness enforcement
- [ ] `GET /api/v3/brokerage/orders/historical/{order_id}` - Get order details
  - [ ] Tested in: `test_coinbase_order_lifecycle.py`
- [ ] `POST /api/v3/brokerage/orders/batch_cancel` - Cancel orders
  - [ ] Tested in: `test_coinbase_order_cancellation.py`

**Account & Portfolio:**
- [ ] `GET /api/v3/brokerage/accounts` - List accounts
  - [ ] Spot accounts tested
  - [ ] Perpetual accounts tested (if INTX)
- [ ] `GET /api/v3/brokerage/accounts/{account_id}` - Account details
- [ ] `GET /api/v3/brokerage/products` - Product catalog
  - [ ] Tested in: `test_product_catalog.py`
  - [ ] Validates tick sizes, lot sizes, min order sizes

**Market Data:**
- [ ] `GET /api/v3/brokerage/products/{product_id}/ticker` - Latest price
- [ ] `GET /api/v3/brokerage/products/{product_id}/candles` - Historical OHLCV
  - [ ] Tested in: `test_ohlcv_fetcher.py`

**Validation:**
- [ ] Run endpoint coverage report:
  ```bash
  poetry run python scripts/analysis/coinbase_endpoint_coverage.py
  ```
- [ ] Cross-reference with Coinbase Advanced Trade API docs (Oct 2025)
- [ ] Confirm all critical endpoints have integration test coverage

---

## 4. WebSocket Channel Coverage

**Required Channels:**
- [ ] `ticker` - Real-time price updates
  - [ ] Tested in: `test_streaming_ticker.py`
  - [ ] Validates last trade price, bid/ask spread
- [ ] `level2` - Order book snapshots (optional for spot)
  - [ ] Integration test exists: `test_streaming_orderbook.py`
- [ ] `user` - Account updates, order fills
  - [ ] Tested in: `test_streaming_user_events.py`
  - [ ] Validates fill events trigger P&L updates

**Optional Channels (Future):**
- [ ] `heartbeats` - Connection health monitoring
- [ ] `candles` - Real-time OHLCV (if available)

**Validation:**
- [ ] Run WebSocket integration tests in sandbox:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest tests/integration/streaming/ -m real_api --verbose
  ```
- [ ] Verify message parsing handles all expected event types
- [ ] Test reconnection logic on simulated disconnect

---

## 5. Fee Tier & Slippage Assumptions

**Current Assumptions (in `config/risk/spot_top10.yaml`):**
```yaml
slippage_guard_bps: 60  # 0.6% slippage guard
```

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Confirm actual fee tier via `--account-snapshot`:
  ```bash
  poetry run perps-bot --account-snapshot --profile spot_top10
  ```
- [ ] Compare actual fees vs. assumptions:
  - Maker fee: ____% (actual) vs. 0.40% (assumed)
  - Taker fee: ____% (actual) vs. 0.60% (assumed)
- [ ] Update risk config if mismatch detected:
  - [ ] Adjust `slippage_guard_bps` if fees higher than assumed
  - [ ] Document fee tier in `config/risk/spot_top10.yaml` comments

**Slippage Validation:**
- [ ] Review historical fill data to validate 0.6% slippage guard is sufficient
- [ ] Test in sandbox: execute limit orders and measure execution price vs. mark price
- [ ] Adjust slippage guard if sandbox data suggests higher slippage

---

## 6. Product Specifications & Quantization

**Tick Size / Lot Size Validation:**
- [ ] Verify `ProductCatalog` correctly loads from Coinbase `/products` endpoint
- [ ] Test quantization for all trading pairs:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/test_specs_quantization.py -v
  ```
- [ ] Validate minimum order sizes respected:
  - BTC-USD: $10 minimum (check: `product_catalog.py`)
  - ETH-USD: $10 minimum
  - SOL-USD: $10 minimum
  - (etc. for all symbols in `spot_top10.yaml`)

**Potential Issues:**
- [ ] Confirm tick sizes haven't changed (e.g., BTC-USD: $0.01 tick size)
- [ ] Verify lot sizes for low-price assets (e.g., DOGE-USD: 0.00000001 lot size)
- [ ] Test rounding errors in position sizing:
  ```python
  # Example: Ensure $100 order on SOL-USD quantizes correctly
  poetry run pytest tests/unit/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/test_order_payloads.py::test_sol_usd_quantization
  ```

---

## 7. Monitoring & Observability

**Prometheus Metrics Validation:**
- [ ] Verify exporter captures all critical Coinbase API metrics:
  - [ ] `gpt_trader_coinbase_api_requests_total{endpoint, method, status}` - Request counter
  - [ ] `gpt_trader_coinbase_api_latency_seconds{endpoint}` - Latency histogram
  - [ ] `gpt_trader_coinbase_rate_limit_hits_total` - Rate limit 429 responses
  - [ ] `gpt_trader_coinbase_order_fills_total{symbol, side}` - Fill events
  - [ ] `gpt_trader_coinbase_websocket_reconnects_total` - Reconnection counter

**Grafana Dashboard Validation:**
- [ ] Check `monitoring/grafana/dashboards/trading_activity.json` includes:
  - [ ] Coinbase API latency panel (p50, p95, p99)
  - [ ] Order fill rate panel (fills/minute)
  - [ ] Rate limit hit rate panel (429 responses/hour)
  - [ ] WebSocket connection health panel (uptime, reconnects)

**Alerting Rules:**
- [ ] Review `monitoring/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml` for Coinbase-specific alerts:
  - [ ] High rate limit hit rate (>10 per minute) → WARNING
  - [ ] API errors >5% of requests → CRITICAL
  - [ ] WebSocket disconnected >30 seconds → CRITICAL
  - [ ] Order fill latency >10 seconds → WARNING

**Validation:**
- [ ] Deploy monitoring stack in sandbox:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_sandbox_soak.sh
  ```
- [ ] Execute test orders and verify metrics appear in Grafana
- [ ] Trigger test alerts to validate routing (PagerDuty/Slack)

---

## 8. Error Handling & Resilience

**Coinbase API Error Codes (Common):**
- `400` - Invalid request (malformed order)
- `401` - Authentication failure
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Order not found
- `429` - Rate limit exceeded
- `500` - Coinbase internal error
- `503` - Service unavailable

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Review `src/bot_v2/features/brokerages/coinbase/error_handler.py` for error mapping
- [ ] Verify each error code has appropriate handling:
  - [ ] `400` → Validation error (log + reject order)
  - [ ] `401` → Credential error (alert + shutdown)
  - [ ] `403` → Permissions error (alert + shutdown)
  - [ ] `429` → Rate limit (backoff + retry)
  - [ ] `500`/`503` → Transient error (exponential backoff + retry up to 3x)
- [ ] Test error scenarios in sandbox:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest tests/integration/brokerages/test_coinbase_error_handling.py -v
  ```

**WebSocket Error Handling:**
- [ ] Test reconnection on disconnect (simulated network failure)
- [ ] Verify graceful degradation to REST if WebSocket unavailable:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest tests/integration/streaming/test_websocket_rest_fallback.py
  ```

---

## 9. Risk Controls Validation

**Pre-Trade Risk Checks:**
- [ ] Verify risk gates fire on Coinbase-specific limits:
  - [ ] Daily loss limit enforced (`config/risk/spot_top10.yaml`: $250)
  - [ ] Position size limits per symbol enforced
  - [ ] Max exposure percentage enforced (60%)
- [ ] Test in sandbox:
  ```bash
  # Execute orders exceeding risk limits
  poetry run pytest tests/integration/orchestration/test_risk_gates.py -v
  ```

**Runtime Risk Monitoring:**
- [ ] Verify circuit breakers activate on Coinbase API errors:
  - [ ] 3 consecutive order rejections → reduce-only mode
  - [ ] 5 consecutive API errors → kill switch
- [ ] Test volatility circuit breaker:
  - [ ] Inject simulated high volatility (22% threshold) → reduce-only mode
  - [ ] Inject extreme volatility (28% threshold) → kill switch

**Post-Trade Risk Monitoring:**
- [ ] Verify P&L calculations include Coinbase fees:
  - [ ] Maker fee: 0.40%
  - [ ] Taker fee: 0.60%
- [ ] Test daily loss limit enforcement:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest tests/integration/risk/test_daily_loss_limit.py
  ```

---

## 10. Sandbox Soak Test

**Test Duration:** 24-48 hours minimum

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Deploy to sandbox using soak test script:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_sandbox_soak.sh
  ```
- [ ] Monitor for 24-48 hours:
  - [ ] Zero uncaught exceptions
  - [ ] No order rejections (except intentional risk gate tests)
  - [ ] WebSocket maintains stable connection (reconnects <5 per day)
  - [ ] API latency p95 <500ms
  - [ ] Rate limit hits <10 per hour
- [ ] Validate metrics collection:
  - [ ] Grafana dashboards populate correctly
  - [ ] Prometheus alerts fire on simulated failures
  - [ ] Logs capture all order lifecycle events

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Bot runs for 48 hours without manual intervention
- [ ] All guardrails (circuit breakers, risk gates) activate as expected
- [ ] Monitoring captures all critical events
- [ ] No data loss on WebSocket reconnections

---

## 11. Production Pre-Flight

**Final Checks Before Production:**
- [ ] Switch `.env` to production Coinbase credentials
- [ ] Verify production risk config loaded:
  ```bash
  poetry run perps-bot --validate-config --profile production
  ```
- [ ] Confirm production API permissions match sandbox
- [ ] Review production fee tier (may differ from sandbox):
  ```bash
  poetry run perps-bot --account-snapshot --profile production
  ```
- [ ] Validate production monitoring stack deployed:
  - [ ] Grafana accessible
  - [ ] Prometheus scraping metrics
  - [ ] Alerts routing to PagerDuty/Slack
- [ ] Conduct dry-run in production (reduce-only mode):
  ```bash
  REDUCE_ONLY=1 poetry run perps-bot --profile production
  ```

**Rollback Plan:**
- [ ] Document rollback procedure in `docs/ops/operations_runbook.md`
- [ ] Identify on-call engineer for production deployment
- [ ] Prepare hotfix branch for emergency fixes

---

## 12. Post-Deployment Validation

**Within 1 Hour:**
- [ ] Verify first live order executes successfully
- [ ] Confirm fill event captured in metrics
- [ ] Check P&L calculation includes actual fees
- [ ] Monitor API latency (should match sandbox p95 <500ms)

**Within 24 Hours:**
- [ ] Validate daily loss limit resets correctly at UTC midnight
- [ ] Confirm no rate limit hits under normal trading volume
- [ ] Review logs for any unexpected Coinbase API errors
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connection stable (0 unplanned reconnects)

**Within 1 Week:**
- [ ] Compare actual slippage vs. configured guard (0.6%)
- [ ] Review fee tier efficiency (maker vs. taker ratio)
- [ ] Analyze order rejection rate (target: <1%)
- [ ] Validate circuit breaker false positive rate (target: 0%)
