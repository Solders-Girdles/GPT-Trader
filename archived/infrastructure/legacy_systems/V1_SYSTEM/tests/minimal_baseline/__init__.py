"""
Minimal Test Baseline for GPT-Trader

This package contains the core 20-30 tests that MUST pass for the system
to be considered minimally functional. These tests verify:

1. Core imports work
2. Data pipeline functions
3. Strategies generate signals
4. Basic integration works
5. Risk limits are enforced

All tests in this package should ACTUALLY RUN without import errors
and test REAL functionality, not mocks of mocks.
